<p>The data for expected standards in development shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in 2015/16, two-thirds of all children achieved at least the expected standard in development</p>

<li>
<p>in the broad ethnic groups, White children and children of Mixed ethnicity were most likely to meet the expected standard</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the more specific ethnic groups, children of Indian and Mixed White and Asian ethnic groups were most likely to meet the expected standard</p>

<li>
<p>children of all ethnicities eligible for free school meals (FSM) were less likely to meet the expected standard than non-eligible children, except Gypsy/Roma children</p>

                    <p>In 2015/16 there were 93,538 children eligible for FSM in early years foundation stage (14% of children).</p>
<p>Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology</a> section. </p>
<p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>overall, 52% of FSM-eligible children met the expected standard in 2015/16 compared with 70% of non-eligible children (a gap of 18 percentage points)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attainment was lower for FSM-eligible children than for non-eligible children in all ethnic groups except the Gypsy/Roma group</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Traveller children of Irish heritage, at 25%, had the lowest attainment of all FSM-eligible children</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Indian children, at 62%, had the highest attainment of all FSM-eligible children </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>48% of White Irish children eligible for FSM met the expected standard, compared with 73% of White Irish children who were not eligible – a gap of 25 percentage points, the largest of all ethnic groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>59% of Bangladeshi children eligible for FSM met the expected standard compared with 62% of Bangladeshi children who were not eligible – a gap of 3 percentage points, the smallest in all ethnic groups</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>attainment of FSM-eligible children in these groups was lower than the national average: White British (50%), Other White ethnicity (50%), White Irish (48%), Gypsy/Roma (27%) and Traveller of Irish Heritage (25%)</p>

<p>girls were more likely to meet the expected standard than boys in all ethnic groups</p>

<p>19% of boys of White Irish Traveller heritage met the expected standard – the lowest attainment of all eligible children</p>

<li>
<p>girls of Other Black ethnicities were most likely to meet the expected standard at 70% compared with all other groups</p>

<li>
<p>the attainment gap between girls and boys was largest for Black Caribbean children (22 percentage points), and smallest for Gypsy/Roma children (9 percentage points) </p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The EYFSP is an assessment by teachers of children’s development. Children are assessed at the end of the school year in which they turn 5. </p>
<p>The EYFSP dataset is an statutory annual collection of child-level data from all local authorities in England, which runs from June to the end of August.</p>
<p>In the 2015/16 EYFSP collection, valid results for 669,151 children were reported. </p>
<p>Ethnicity isn’t collected as part of the EYFSP collection. So the EYFSP attainment data is matched to data on the National Pupil Database (NPD) to get information broken down by ethnic group. The NPD is linked to the school census, which provides information on ethnicity.</p>
<p>There were discrepancies between the two sets of data. Of the 669,151 children for whom valid results were reported in the EYFSP dataset, 669,052 were found in the NPD.</p>
<p>Of these 669,052 children, ethnicity was not found for 56,145 children (8.4%). </p>
<p>A new profile was introduced in September 2012. The first assessments using the new profile took place in summer 2013, so comparisons cannot be made with profile results from before 2013.</p>
<p>Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive FSM, not only those who actually received FSM. Pupils not eligible for FSM or unclassified pupils are described as ‘non-FSM’ or ‘all other pupils’. </p>
<p>Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">qualifying benefit</a>.</p>
<p>FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage, but when drawing conclusions, it should be remembered that not all eligible parents apply for FSM. Families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF) .</p>
<p>The DfE does not publish school-level data for the early years foundation stage. Figures for the Isles of Scilly have therefore been suppressed because there is only one school in the Isles of Scilly.</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>

                <p>The early years foundation stage profile (EYFSP) supports children's transition to key stage 1 (KS1). It should improve professional dialogue between EYFS and KS1 teachers, helping teachers to plan an effective, responsive and appropriate curriculum to meet the needs of all children. </p>
<p>The profile also informs parents or carers about their child’s development against early learning goals.</p>
