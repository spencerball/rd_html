            <p>Please be aware that some of the statistics quoted here for some ethnic groups are based on very small numbers of pupils (for example, only 130 Chinese children were eligible for free school meals in 2015/16) and are highly variable over time.</p>
<p>Attainment is lower for children from a Traveller of Irish heritage background – however, there were only 122 pupils from this background in key stage 4 in 2015/16. This was a much smaller number than for other ethnic groups (for example, there were 20,434 Pakistani pupils in key stage 4). Therefore, data comparisons between Traveller of Irish Heritage pupils and other ethnic groups may be unreliable.</p>
<p>The ethnicity of 1.1% of pupils (5,771) is not known. This includes pupils whose ethnicity was not surveyed, pupils who refused to be surveyed, and pupils whose ethnicity could not be determined.</p>
<p>The Department of Education (DfE) has excluded, or ‘suppressed’, very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular level).</p>
<p>This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality. This is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Data for some Muslim and Sikh schools was not included in the statistics for faith schools, because the small numbers of pupils make it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions about their attainment. Data for faith schools is also only provided for pupils in state-funded mainstream schools.</p>
<p>Schools can ask for a pupil to be removed from their performance results if the pupil:</p>
<ul>
<li>arrived recently from overseas their first language isn’t English</li>
<li>was admitted following a permanent exclusion from another school</li>
<li>is not at the end of key stage 4</li>
<li>has left England to live abroad</li>
<li>has died</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils removed from a school’s performance results may still be included in the national figures.</p>
<p>Any unapproved qualifications, such as unregulated international GCSEs, are not included in this data. Therefore, this data does not represent all qualifications taken by pupils, only those approved by the English Baccalaureate (EBacc), which count towards the secondary school performance tables. The figures vary between ‘all schools’ and ‘state schools’ mainly due to the impact of unregulated international GCSEs taken in independent schools.</p>

                    <p>Pupils with special education needs (SEN) have learning difficulties or disabilities that make it harder for them to learn than most children of the same age. </p>
<p>Since 2015, pupils have been categorised as follows:                                                             </p>

<li>SEN support: extra or different help is given from that provided as part of the school's usual curriculum, and the class teacher and SEN coordinator (SENCO) may receive advice or support from outside specialists</li>
<li>SEN statement or education, health and care (EHC) plan: a pupil is given a SEN statement or an EHC plan once a formal assessment has been made                                                            </li>
</ul>
<p>‘All SEN pupils’ refers to the total number of pupils with either SEN support, a SEN statement or an EHC plan. </p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in 2015/16, there were 78,682 pupils at the end of key stage 4 with SEN: 80% were White, 7% were Asian, 6% were Black, 4% were Mixed and 0.2% were Chinese</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of the 78,682 SEN students in total, 74% had SEN support and 26% had SEN with a statement or EHC plan</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of all SEN pupils, Chinese pupils were most likely to achieve the EBacc (12%), while White and Black pupils were least likely (5%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of pupils with SEN support, Chinese pupils were the most likely to achieve the EBacc (12%), while Black and White pupils were least likely (6%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>of SEN pupils with a statement or EHC plan, Chinese pupils were most likely to achieve the EBacc (13%), while White, Black and Mixed pupils were least likely (2%)</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 4 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 2 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>The census data is provided for all pupils aged 5 and over on 31 August 2016. Any information that still needs to be collected is recorded as ‘not yet obtained’.</p>
<p>If a pupil or parent refused to give information, this is recorded as 'refused'.</p>
<p>These statistics include pupils whose ethnicity was not obtained, who refused to respond, or whose ethnicity could not be determined. </p>
<p>Key stage 4 data received from awarding bodies are combined with pupil characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. Records are matched, using identifiers such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN, gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 98% of results.</p>
<p>The statistics in this commission cover the data collated for the 2016 secondary school performance tables. The performance tables and the related statistical first release report results based on pupils at the end of key stage 4, who are typically aged 15 at the start of the academic year. </p>
<p>The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools in England. This includes city technology colleges and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive free school meals, not only those who actually received free school meals. Pupils not eligible for free school meals or unclassified pupils are described as ‘Non-FSM’ or ‘All other pupils’. </p>
<p>Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">qualifying benefit</a>.</p>
<p>FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage, but when drawing conclusions, it should be remembered that not all eligible parents apply for FSM and families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2, or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved; or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular level are suppressed in circumstances where non-suppression would lead to disclosure of pupils. Some additional figures have been suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed.</p>
<p>This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are given to nearest whole number in tables and charts,  and to 1 decimal place in the downloads.</p>

may receive advice or support from outside specialists\r\n* SEN statement or education, health and care (EHC) plan: a pupil is given a SEN statement or an EHC plan once a formal assessment has been made                                                            \r\n \r\n\u2018All SEN pupils\u2019 refers to the total number of pupils with either SEN support, a SEN statement or an EHC plan.
