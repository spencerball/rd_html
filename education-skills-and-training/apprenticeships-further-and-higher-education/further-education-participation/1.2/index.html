<p>The ILR uses administrative data collected about learners by FE providers.</p>
<p>Data about learners' demographics and the type of learning they're doing is used by ESFA to allocate funding. Ethnicity data is completed by the learner, and no adjustments are made by the learning provider.</p>
<p>Data on learners that forms part of the Employer Ownership Pilot (EOP) is gathered from employers in the same format as the ILR and included in the ILR dataset.</p>
