<p>Before 2011/12, there was a separate data collection for each of the different further education funding models. Some apprentices at the same training provider may have been included in more than one data collection, if they were funded under more than one model during an academic year.

<p>In 2011/12, a single collection for all funding models was introduced. This means that the total number of apprentices is now counted from a single collection and apprentices at each training provider will no longer be counted twice.</p>
<p>This methodology change also means that apprenticeship start numbers are overrepresented by an estimated 1 to 2% for reporting periods from 2002/03 to 2010/11.</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>This data is based on the apprentice’s individualised learner record (ILR), which is submitted by further education (FE) providers to the ESFA.</p>
<p>The ILR uses administrative data collected about learners by FE providers.</p>
<p>Data about apprentices’ demographics and the type of learning they're doing is used by ESFA to allocate funding. Ethnicity data is completed by the apprentice, and no adjustments are made by the learning provider.
Data on apprentices that forms part of the Employer Ownership Pilot (EOP) is gathered from employers in the same format as the ILR and included in the ILR dataset.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Participant numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10 to avoid identification of individuals. </p>
<p>Numbers less than 5 have been suppressed.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Participant numbers are rounded to the nearest 10 except in 2016/17 where numbers have been rounded to the nearest 100</p>

            </h3>
              <p>All providers must send records for learners financed by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan">Advanced Learner Loans</a>. Training organisations are asked to send details of apprenticeships that are not funded by the ESFA where they are delivered within the terms of a ESFA contract. </p>
<p>For higher and degree level apprenticeships, higher education institutions must send an ILR return for all apprenticeship standards and for 16-18 apprenticeship frameworks.</p>
