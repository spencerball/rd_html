         The way data was collected changed in 2011, which means that data from 2002/03 to 2010/11 isn't directly comparable with the data from 2011/12 to 2015/16.
        </p>
        <p>
         Before 2011/12, there was a separate data collection for each of the different further education funding models. Some learners at the same training provider may have been included in more than one data collection, if they were funded under more than one model during an academic year. This means they will have been counted more than once in the official statistics.
        </p>
        <p>
         In 2011/12, a single collection for all funding models was introduced. This means that the total number of learners is now counted from a single collection and learners at each training provider will no longer be counted twice.
        </p>
        <p>
         This methodology change also means that apprenticeship start numbers are overrepresented by an estimated 1% to 2% for reporting periods from 2002/03 to 2010/11.

         This data measures the number of people who had a start date for an apprenticeship programme or learning aim (‘apprenticeship starts’).

        <p>
         Each reporting period covers an academic year, which runs from 1 August to 31 July.

        <p>
         A learner starting more than one apprenticeship is counted separately for each programme. For example, a learner starting an intermediate level apprenticeship, and then starting or transferring to an advanced level apprenticeship, is counted as 2 starts. This can be within 1 academic year or across multiple academic years.

        <p>
         The data only includes people funded by government.
        </p>
        <p>
         To provide additional context, the percentage of people on apprenticeships by ethnic group is compared with 2015 population estimates published by the Office for National Statistics.

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          Data about learners' demographics and their type of learning (including apprenticeships and apprenticeship aims) is used by Education and Skills Funding Agency to allocate funding for further education.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          This data is based on the individualised learner record (ILR), which is submitted by further education (FE) providers to the ESFA.
         </p>
         <p>
          The ILR uses administrative data collected about learners by FE providers.
         </p>
         <p>
          Ethnicity data is completed by the learner, and no adjustments are made by the learning provider.
         </p>
         <p>
          Data on learners that forms part of the Employer Ownership Pilot (EOP) is gathered from employers in the same format as the ILR and included in the ILR dataset.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Rounding
         </h3>
         <p>

          Further technical information
         </h3>
         <p>
          All providers must send records for learners financed by
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/advanced-learner-loan">
           Advanced Learner Loans
          </a>
          . Training organisations are asked to send details of apprenticeships that are not funded by the ESFA where they are delivered within the terms of a ESFA contract.
         </p>
         <p>
          For higher and degree level apprenticeships, higher education institutions must send an ILR return for all apprenticeship standards and for 16-18 apprenticeship frameworks.
