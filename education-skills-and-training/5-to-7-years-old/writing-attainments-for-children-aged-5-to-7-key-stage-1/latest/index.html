<p>Of those whose ethnicity was known, 75% were White, 11% were Asian, 6% were Black, 6% were Mixed, 2% were from the Other ethnic group and 0.5% were Chinese.</p>
<p>The 2015/16 key stage 1 assessments were the first to assess the new, more challenging national curriculum. The expected standard was raised to be higher than the old level 2. As a result, figures for 2015/16 and 2016/17 are not comparable to those for earlier years.</p>
<p>Teacher assessments for year 2 pupils studying the national curriculum are collected and reported by the Department for Education (DfE), but test results for those pupils are not collected.</p>
<p>School level data is not published for key stage 1. Results for the Isles of Scilly and the City of London, which have only one school each, have been excluded from local authority breakdowns. </p>
<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has also excluded, or ‘suppressed’, very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular standard). </p>
<p>This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality.

<p>Pupil numbers for key stage 1 vary between measures of attainment for different subjects.

                    <p>Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology</a> section. </p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17, there were 92,319 pupils eligible for free school meals in year 2 (14% of all pupils)</li>
<li>overall, 52% of FSM-eligible pupils met the expected standard, compared with 71% who were not eligible (a gap of 19 percentage points)</li>
<li>in every ethnic group, FSM-eligible pupils were less likely to meet the expected standard than those not eligible </li>
<li>75% of FSM-eligible Chinese pupils met the expected standard (the highest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible pupils)</li>
<li>21% of FSM-eligible Gypsy/Roma pupils met the expected standard (the lowest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible pupils)</li>
<li>49% of FSM-eligible White British pupils met the expected standard, compared with 72% who were not eligible</li>
<li>the largest gap in attainment between FSM-eligible pupils and those not eligible was found in the White Irish group, where 38% and 73% met the standard respectively (a gap of 35 percentage points)</li>

                    <p>Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology</a> section. </p>
<p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17 there were 92,319 pupils eligible for free school meals in year 2 (14% of all pupils)</li>
<li>across all ethnic groups, a higher percentage of FSM-eligible girls met the expected standard in writing than FSM-eligible boys</li>
<li>83% of  Chinese FSM-eligible girls met the expected standard (the highest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible children)</li>
<li>16% of boys from the Traveller of Irish Heritage ethnic group met the expected standard (the lowest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible children)</li>
<li>among FSM-eligible White British pupils, 57% of girls and 41% of boys met the expected standard (a gap of 16 percentage points)</li>
<li>of all FSM-eligible pupils, the biggest attainment gap between girls and boys, at 22 percentage points, was found among White and Asian pupils (where 66% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 44% of boys)</li>
<li>the smallest attainment gap between those eligible for FSM and those not eligible was found among Gypsy/Roma girls, at 1 percentage point</li>
<li>the largest attainment gap between those eligible for FSM and those not eligible was found among White Irish girls, at 39 percentage points</li>

                    <p>Except for the information for White pupils, the statistics quoted for attainment by ethnicity and local authority are based on small numbers of pupils and are highly variable over time.</p>
<p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall in 2016/17, a higher percentage of girls than boys met the expected standard in writing  in all local authorities</li>
<li>for Asian pupils, the biggest attainment gap between girls and boys was in Cheshire West and Chester in the North West, where 84% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 50% of boys</li>
<li>for Black pupils, the biggest attainment gap was in Leicestershire in East Midlands, where 85% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 46% of boys</li>
<li>for pupils with Mixed ethnicity, the biggest attainment gap was in County of Herefordshire in the West Midlands, where 90% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 50% of boys</li>
<li>for White pupils, the biggest attainment gap was in Darlington in the North East, where 80% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 60% of boys </li>
<li>comparisons between Chinese girls and boys are not possible because of the small number of local authorities with data available for this group</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 1 dataset is compiled using information matched together from 2 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>key stage 1 teacher assessment results</li>
<li>school census records</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage 1 results received from local authorities are combined with pupil characteristics from the school census. Records are matched using identifiers such as surname, forename, date of birth, unique pupil number, gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 98% of results.</p>
<p>Key stage 1 assessment results are not published at school level. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is for state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>The information is collected from 16,369 state-funded schools (approximately 654,000 pupils).</p>
<p>Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive FSM, not only those who actually received FSM. Pupils not eligible for FSM or unclassified pupils are described as ‘non-FSM’ or ‘all other pupils’. </p>
<p>Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">qualifying benefit</a>.</p>
<p>FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage, but when drawing conclusions, it should be remembered that not all eligible parents apply for FSM. Families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid key stage 1 outcome for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages. For reading, writing and mathematics, the valid outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>below the pre-key stage standard </li>
<li>foundations for the expected standard</li>
<li>working towards the expected standard</li>
<li>working at the expected standard</li>
<li>working at greater depth within the expected standard</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>disapplied</li>
</ul>
<p>For science, the valid outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>has not met the expected standard</li>
<li>working at the expected standard</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>disapplied</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils with an outcome of ‘absent’ or ‘disapplied’ are included to ensure complete coverage of the cohort.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF) .</p>
<p>Figures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in DfE’s key stage 2 provisional Statistical First Release as these local authorities have a single school and DfE do not publish school-level information in the performance tables at the time of the provisional release. These figures are unsuppressed in the revised release as school-level figures are already published in the performance tables.</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school-level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort. For example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages given in charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number. For this reason some figures may not exactly match those published by the Department for Education.</p>
