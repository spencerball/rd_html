         Results are presented for the academic year 2015/16. The data includes pupils in year 1 in 2015/16 who took and passed the phonics test. It also includes pupils in year 2 in 2015/16 who were retaking the test because they were missed, or had failed it, in year 1.

         Results for the Isles of Scilly and the City of London, which have only one school each, have been excluded from local authority breakdowns. This is because the very small number of pupils in these local authorities make the results unreliable.

This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality. This is consistent with

         This data measures the percentage of pupils who met the phonics expected standard at the end of year 1 and the end of year 2 in key stage 1 (when children are aged 5 to 7).
        </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>
         The phonics approach helps children to learn to read by teaching them the sounds made by letters in the English language. They can then combine these sounds into words, for both reading and writing.
        </p>
        <p>
         All pupils in state-funded mainstream schools take the phonics screening checks at the end of year 1 to see if they’ve reached the expected standard. Pupils who don’t meet the standard, or who weren’t checked, are checked again at the end of year 2.
        </p>
        <p>
         The test consists of 20 real words and 20 made-up words that pupils read out loud to a teacher.

       Summary
      </h3>
      <div class="bullets spaced-out">
       <p>
        Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the
        <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">
         Methodology
        </a>
        section.
       </p>
       <p>
        The data shows that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          across all ethnic groups, FSM-eligible pupils were less likely to meet the expected standard than other pupils, except Gypsy/Roma pupils
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          69% of FSM-eligible pupils met the expected standard, compared with 83% of all other pupils (a gap of 14 percentage points)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          among all FSM-eligible pupils, Indian children were most likely to meet the expected standard – 81% did so
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          across all ethnic groups, FSM-eligible pupils from a Traveller of Irish Heritage Background were least likely to meet the expected standard (35%)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          the biggest gap  in attainment, at 24 percentage points, was found among Irish pupils, where 60% of FSM-eligible pupils met the expected standard compared with 84% of those not eligible
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          for White British children, the attainment gap between pupils eligible for FSM and those not eligible was 83% and 66% respectively (a gap of 17 percentage points)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          for Gypsy/Roma pupils, there was no difference in attainment between those eligible for FSM and those not eligible (both at 37%)
         </p>

        Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the
        <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">
         Methodology
        </a>
        section.

       <p>
        The data at the end of year 1 shows that:
       </p>
       <ul>
        <li>
         <p>
          in every ethnic group, boys and girls not eligible for FSM did better than those who were eligible, except Gypsy/Roma girls where pupils eligble for FSM  did better
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          within every ethnic group, girls eligible for FSM did better than boys eligible for FSM
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          overall, among FSM-eligible pupils, girls out-performed boys at the end of year 1: 74% of girls met the expected standard, compared to 64% of boys
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          30% of Travellers of Irish Heritage boys eligible for FSM met the expected standard (the lowest percentage of any FSM-eligible ethnic group)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          86% of Chinese girls eligible for FSM met the expected standard (the highest percentage of any FSM-eligible ethnic group)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          the biggest gap between boys and girls was found in the Mixed White and Asian group, where 81% of girls met the expected standard, compared to 64% of boys (a gap of 17 percentage points)
         </p>
        </li>
        <li>
         <p>
          the biggest gap in attainment between FSM-eligible and non-eligible pupils was found among Irish boys and girls – 82% of non-eligible boys met the expected standard compared to 57% of eligible boys (a gap of 25 percentage points), while 86% of non-eligible girls met the expected standard compared to 62% of eligible girls (a gap of 24 percentage points)

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          This data provides results for the 2016 phonics screening checks and key stage 1 national curriculum assessments for pupils in schools in England. The results are used to monitor pupils’ attainment and progress in reading, writing, science and mathematics.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          The phonics dataset is put together using information matched together from 2 data sources:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           phonics results in year 1, plus those in year 2 who didn't pass the check in year 1
          </li>
          <li>
           the school census record
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          Key stage 1 results received from local authorities are combined with pupil characteristics from the school census. Records are matched using identifiers such as surname, forename, date of birth, unique pupil number, gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 98% of results.
         </p>
         <p>
          Phonics results are not published at school level. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is for state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.
         </p>
         <p>
          The information was collected from 16,337 schools (approximately 650,000 pupils).
         </p>
         <p>
          Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive FSM, not only those who actually received FSM. Pupils not eligible for FSM or unclassified pupils are described as ‘non-FSM’ or ‘all other pupils’.
         </p>
         <p>
          Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">
           qualifying benefit
          </a>
          .
         </p>
         <p>
          FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage, but when drawing conclusions, it should be remembered that not all eligible parents apply for FSM. Families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.

          Suppression rules
         </h3>
         <p>
          Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with
          <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">
           DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality
          </a>
          (PDF) .
         </p>
         <p>
          Figures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in DfE’s key stage 2 provisional Statistical First Release as these local authorities have a single school and DfE do not publish school-level information in the performance tables at the time of the provisional release. These figures are unsuppressed in the revised release as school-level figures are already published in the performance tables.
         </p>
         <p>
          Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the school-level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort. For example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Disclosure control
         </h3>
         <p>
          The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.
         </p>
         <p>

a Traveller of Irish Heritage Background were least likely to meet the expected standard (35%)\r\n\r\n* the biggest gap  in attainment, at 24 percentage points, was found among Irish pupils, where 60%
