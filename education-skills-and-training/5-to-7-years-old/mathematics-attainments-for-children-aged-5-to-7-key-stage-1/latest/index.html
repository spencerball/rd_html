            <p>In 2016/17, there were 653,945 pupils at the end of year 2, and ethnicity was known for 646,520 (99%) of them.</p>
<p>Of those whose ethnicity was known, 75% were White, 11% were Asian, 6% were Black, 6% were Mixed, 2% were from the Other ethnic group and 0.5% were Chinese.</p>
<p>The 2015/16 key stage 1 assessments were the first to assess the new, more challenging national curriculum. The expected standard was raised to be higher than the old level 2. As a result, figures for 2015/16 and 2016/17 are not comparable to those for earlier years.</p>
<p>Teacher assessments for year 2 pupils studying the national curriculum are collected and reported by the Department for Education (DfE), but test results for those pupils are not collected.</p>
<p>School level data is not published for key stage 1. Results for the Isles of Scilly and the City of London, which have only one school each, have been excluded from local authority breakdowns.</p>
<p>The Department for Education (DfE) has also excluded, or ‘suppressed’, very small numbers (for example, values of 1 or 2, a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or 0, 1 or 2 pupils who did not achieve a particular standard).</p>
<p>This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality. This is consistent with <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Pupil numbers for key stage 1 vary between measures of attainment for different subjects. This is because pupils who don't have a valid teacher assessment for a particular subject are excluded from the total.

                    <p>Eligibility for free school meals (FSM) is used as an indicator of deprivation by the Department for Education. For more about who qualifies for FSM, see the <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology</a> section. </p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17 there were 92,319 pupils eligible for free school meals in year 2 (14% of all pupils)</li>
<li>overall, 60% of pupils eligible for FSM met the expected standard in mathematics, compared with 78% of those not eligible (a gap of 18 percentage points)</li>
<li>in every ethnic group, FSM-eligible pupils were less likely to meet the expected standard than those not eligible</li>
<li>58% of FSM-eligible White British pupils met the expected standard, compared with 78% of those not eligible (a gap of 20 percentage points)</li>
<li>85% of FSM-eligible Chinese pupils met the expected standard (the highest percentage of any ethnic group)</li>
<li>the largest gap in attainment between FSM-eligible pupils and those not eligible was found in the White Irish group, where 45% and 80% met the expected standard respectively (a gap of 35 percentage points)</li>

<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17 there were 92,319 pupils eligible for FSM in year 2 (14% of all pupils)</li>
<li>overall, 61% of FSM-eligible girls met the expected standard in mathematics compared with 59% of FSM-eligible boys</li>
<li>among White British FSM-eligible pupils, 59% of girls met the expected standard, compared with 57% of boys</li>
<li>89% of FSM-eligible Chinese girls met the expected standard (the highest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible pupils)</li>
<li>26% of FSM-eligible Gypsy/Roma boys met the expected standard (the lowest percentage of any group of FSM-eligible pupils)</li>
<li>the largest gap in attainment between FSM-eligible boys and girls was found among Black Caribbean pupils, where 55% and 65% met the expected standard respectively (a gap of 10 percentage points)</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 1 dataset is compiled using information matched together from 2 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>key stage 1 teacher assessment results</li>
<li>school census records</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage 1 results received from local authorities are combined with pupil characteristics from the school census. Records are matched using identifiers such as surname, forename, date of birth, unique pupil number, gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 98% of results.</p>
<p>Key stage 1 assessment results are not published at school level. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is for state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>The information is collected from 16,369 schools (approximately 654,000 pupils).</p>
<p>Pupils are included in the figures for free school meals (FSM) if their families have claimed eligibility for FSM at the time of the annual spring school census. This FSM definition includes all who were eligible to receive FSM, not only those who actually received FSM. Pupils not eligible for FSM or unclassified pupils are described as ‘non-FSM’ or ‘all other pupils’. </p>
<p>Parents are able to claim FSM if they receive a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/apply-free-school-meals">qualifying benefit</a>.</p>
<p>FSM is used as an indicator of disadvantage, but when drawing conclusions, it should be remembered that not all eligible parents apply for FSM. Families who don’t quite reach the eligibility threshold for FSM may still be suffering deprivation.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid key stage 1 outcome for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages. For reading, writing and mathematics, the valid outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>below the pre-key stage standard </li>
<li>foundations for the expected standard</li>
<li>working towards the expected standard</li>
<li>working at the expected standard</li>
<li>working at greater depth within the expected standard</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>disapplied</li>
</ul>
<p>For science, the valid outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>has not met the expected standard</li>
<li>working at the expected standard</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>disapplied</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils with an outcome of ‘absent’ or ‘disapplied’ are included to ensure complete coverage of the cohort.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF) .</p>
<p>Figures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in DfE’s key stage 2 provisional Statistical First Release as these local authorities have a single school and DfE do not publish school-level information in the performance tables at the time of the provisional release. These figures are unsuppressed in the revised release as school-level figures are already published in the performance tables.</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school-level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort. For example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages given in charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number. For this reason some figures may not exactly match those published by the Department for Education.</p>
