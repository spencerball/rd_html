      </p>
            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>overall, in 2016/17, 72% of pupils met the expected standard in reading by the end of key stage 2 (when they are usually aged 10 or 11 years), and 25% met the higher standard</li>
<li>pupils from the Chinese ethnic group were most likely to meet both the expected standard and the higher standard, out of all ethnic groups</li>
<li>pupils from the Irish and Chinese ethnic groups had the joint highest average scaled score; Irish pupils made the most progress in reading between key stage 1 and key stage 2 (between the ages of 7 and 11 years)</li>
<li>Gypsy/Roma children were least likely to meet both the expected and higher standards; they also had the lowest average scaled score, and made the least progress in reading between key stage 1 and key stage 2</li>
<li>across all ethnic groups, girls were more likely to meet the expected and higher standards in reading; they also had a higher average scale score and made more progress between key stage 1 and key stage 2 than boys</li>
<li>the local authorities with the highest percentage of pupils meeting the expected standard were the City of London (where 88% did so) and Richmond upon Thames (86%); the data for the City of London is based on small numbers of pupils and is therefore highly variable over time</li>

            <p>This data measures the reading attainment of children at the end of key stage 2 (year 6) when children are aged 10 to 11 years.</p>
<p>The data covers the academic year 2016/17 (September 2016 to July 2017).  Data for the academic year 2015/16 is available in the <a href="#download-the-data">download file</a>.</p>
<p>Standards in reading are divided into 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>expected standard – to meet this, pupils must have achieved a ‘scaled score’ of 100 or more</li>
<li>higher standard – to meet this, pupils must have achieved a ‘scaled score’ of 110 or more</li>
</ul>
<p>For each ethnic group, there are also figures for:</p>
<ul>
<li>average scaled score</li>
<li>progress score</li>
</ul>
<p>The average scaled score measures the average attainment of pupils in key stage 2 reading tests. Results range from 80 to 120. A scaled score allows for variations in test difficulty year on year by standardising each pupil’s test results. This allows a clearer comparison between years. You can read more about <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/scaled-scores-at-key-stage-2">scaled scores at key stage 2</a>.</p>
<p>The progress score measures the progress that pupils make between the end of key stage 1 (primary school year 2) and the end of key stage 2 (year 6). A pupil’s results are compared with the actual achievements of other pupils nationally with similar key stage 1 attainment. </p>
<p>This data shows an average progress score for each ethnic group. A progress score of 0 (the national average) means pupils are making the expected amount of progress. A positive score (0.1 and above) means they are making more progress than expected, and a negative score (-0.1 and below) less progress than expected.</p>

                    <p>Except for the information for White pupils, the statistics quoted for attainment by ethnicity and local authority are often based on small numbers of pupils and are therefore highly variable over time. The number of pupils from different ethnic groups varies considerably between local authorities, and data isn't published for some local authorities where the number of pupils is 5 or fewer. For these reasons, you should avoid comparing differences in attainment between local authorities. </p>
<p>The Isle of Scilly had 17 pupils in year 6, and the City of London had 26 – results for these local authorities are particularly variable, and any comparisons with them are not recommended.</p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17, 88% of pupils in the City of London local authority met the expected standard in reading by the end of key stage 2 – this was the highest percentage out of all local authorities, followed by Richmond upon Thames (also in London), where 86% of pupils met the standard</li>
<li>100% of Asian pupils met the expected standard in Herefordshire (West Midlands) and Plymouth (South West), while 28% did so in North Somerset – these were the highest and lowest percentages of Asian pupils meeting the standard out of all local authorities</li>
<li>86% of Black pupils met the expected standard in Sutton (London), while 38% did so in Bath and North East Somerset (South West)</li>
<li>100% of pupils from the Chinese ethnic group met the expected standard in 12 local authorities (out of the 70 for which data was available), while 55% did so in Wakefield (Yorkshire and The Humber)</li>
<li>89% of pupils with Mixed ethnicity met the expected standard in Richmond upon Thames (London), while 60% did so in Hartlepool (North East)</li>
<li>87% of White pupils met the expected standard in Richmond Upon Thames (London), while 62% did so in both Peterborough (East of England) and Leicester (East Midlands)</li>

                  <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                    <p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall, in 2016/17, 75% of girls and 68% of boys met the expected standard in reading by the end of key stage 2 (when they are aged 10 to 11 years), while 28% of girls and 21% of boys met the higher standard; girls were more likely to meet the expected and higher standards than boys in every ethnic group</li>
<li>84% of girls from the Chinese ethnic group met the expected standard and 44% met the higher standard, the highest percentages in any ethnic group across boys and girls</li>
<li>23% of Gypsy/Roma boys met the expected standard and 3% of Traveller of Irish Heritage boys met the higher standard, the lowest percentages in any ethnic group across boys and girls </li>
</ul>
<p>The ‘average scaled score’ measures the average attainment of pupils for each ethnic group, with scores ranging from 80 to 120. The average scaled score data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>overall, the average scaled score was 105 for girls and 103 for boys</li>
<li>girls from the Irish and Chinese ethnic groups had the highest average scaled score (both at 108), while Gypsy/Roma boys had the lowest average scaled score (at 94)</li>
<li>overall, girls made above average progress in reading between key stage 1 and key stage 2 (at 0.3 points), while boys made below average progress (at -0.3 points); average progress is expressed as a score of 0.0</li>
<li>Irish girls made the most progress in reading, with a score of 2.3 points; boys from Gypsy/Roma background made the least progress in reading, with a score of -1.8 points</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 2 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 1 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage assessment data received from the Standard Testing Agency (STA) is combined with information on pupil's characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. Records are matched, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN (unique pupil number), gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 60% to 75% of pupils.</p>
<p>Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid result for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.</p>
<p>Valid results for the national test figures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>not achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>special consideration</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>working below the standard of the test</li>
<li>unable to access the test</li>
</ul>
<p>Confidence intervals:</p>
<p>Confidence intervals are available for the ‘progress score’ if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a>. These confidence intervals are calculated for a school based on a specific group of pupils. A school may have been just as effective, but have performed differently with a different set of pupils. Similarly, some pupils may be more likely to achieve high or low results, independently of which school they attend. To account for this natural uncertainty, it is best to interpret these school scores alongside their associated confidence intervals. </p>
<p>A 95% confidence interval around progress scores means that if the progress scores of 100 random schools were taken, then 95 times out of 100 their progress score would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.</p>
<p>School scores are interpreted alongside their associated confidence intervals in the following manner: If the lower confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the school has achieved greater than average progress compared to pupils with similar starting points nationally. Similarly, if the upper confidence interval is below zero, then the school has made less than average progress. Where the 95% confidence intervals overlap zero, this means that the school’s progress score is not significantly different from the national average.</p>
<p>Changes to assessment:</p>
<p>Because of a change in the way pupils are assessed, data published before 2016 is not comparable to 2015/16 and 2016/17 data.</p>
<p>The system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.</p>
<p>This measure has been replaced by 'value added' progress measures in reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
<p>There is no 'target' for the amount of progress an individual pupil is expected to make, and any amount of progress a pupil makes contributes towards the school's progress scores.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages given in charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number. Progress scores are given to 1 decimal place.</p>
