            <p>This data measures the grammar, punctuation and spelling attainment of children in key stage 2 (years 3 to 6, when pupils are aged between 7 and 11).</p>
<p>The data covers the academic year 2015/16 (September 2015 to July 2016).</p>
<p>Key stage 2 test results range from 80 to 120 on a ‘scaled score’. (A ‘scaled score’ allows for variations in test difficulty year on year by standardising each pupil’s test results. This allows a clearer comparison between years.) </p>
<p>The standards for this measure, which combines grammar, punctuation and spelling, are divided in 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>expected standard</li>
<li>higher standard</li>
</ul>
<p>To reach the expected standard, pupils must have achieved a scaled score of 100 or more in their key stage 2 grammar, punctuation and spelling tests.</p>
<p>To reach the higher standard, pupils must have achieved a score of 110 or more in their key stage 2 grammar, punctuation and spelling tests. </p>
<p>The average scaled score measures the average attainment of pupils in key stage 2 tests. This data compares the average scaled score for all children in England with the score for particular ethnic groups.</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 2 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 1 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage assessment data received from the Standard Testing Agency (STA) is combined with information on pupil's characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. 
Records are matched, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN (unique pupil number), gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 60% to 70% of pupils.</p>
<p>Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>The system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.</p>
<p>Because of the changes to the curriculum, figures for 2016 are not comparable to those for earlier years.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid result for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.</p>
<p>Valid results for the national test figures are: </p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>not achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>special consideration</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>working below the standard of the test</li>
<li>unable to access the test</li>
</ul>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Figures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in DfE’s key stage 2 provisional Statistical First Release as these local authorities have a single school and DfE do not publish school level information in the performance tables at the time of the provisional release. These figures are unsuppressed in the revised release as school level figures are already published in the performance tables.</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
