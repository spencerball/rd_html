            <p>This data measures the grammar, punctuation and spelling attainment of children  at the end of key stage 2 (year 6), when children are aged 10 to 11 years. </p>
<p>The data covers the academic year 2016/17 (September 2016 to July 2017).  Data for the academic year 2015/16 is available in the <a href="#download-the-data">download file</a>.</p>
<p>The standards are divided in 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>expected standard – to meet this, pupils must have achieved a ‘scaled score’ of 100 or more in their grammar, punctuation and spelling tests</li>
<li>higher standard – to meet this, pupils must have achieved a ‘scaled score’ of 110 or more in their grammar, punctuation and spelling tests </li>
</ul>
<p>The average scaled score measures the average attainment of pupils in key stage 2 grammar, punctuation and spelling tests. Results range from 80 to 120. A scaled score allows for variations in test difficulty year on year by standardising each pupil’s test results. This allows a clearer comparison between years.

                    <p>Except for the information for White pupils, the statistics quoted for attainment by ethnicity and local authority are often based on small numbers of pupils and are therefore highly variable over time. The number of pupils from different ethnic groups varies considerably between local authorities, and data isn't published for some local authorities where the number of pupils is 5 or fewer. For these reasons, you should avoid comparing differences in attainment between local authorities.</p>
<p>The Isle of Scilly had 17 pupils in year 6, and the City of London had 26 – results for these local authorities are particularly variable, and any comparisons with them are not recommended.</p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17, 92% of pupils in the City of London local authority met the expected standard in grammar, punctuation and spelling by the end of key stage 2 – this was the highest percentage out of all local authorities, followed by Kensington and Chelsea (London), where 91% of pupils met the standard</li>
<li>the local authorities where the lowest percentage of pupils met the expected standard (at 70%) were Norfolk and Peterborough (both in the East of England), and the Isle of Wight, and Medway (both in the South East)</li>
<li>100% of Asian pupils met the expected standard in Rutland (East Midlands), Herefordshire (West Midlands), Plymouth, and Torbay (both in the South West), while 74% did so in Cornwall (South West) – these were the highest and lowest percentages of Asian pupils meeting the standard out of all local authorities</li>
<li>100% of Black pupils met the expected standard in South Tyneside (North East), Wirral (North West) and Dorset (South West), while 50% did so in Shropshire (West Midlands) </li>
<li>100% of Chinese pupils met the expected standard in 28 local authorities (out of the 74 for which data was available), while 55% did so in Wakefield (in Yorkshire and the Humber)</li>
<li>92% of pupils with Mixed ethnicity met the expected standard in Kensington and Chelsea (London) and Stockton-on-Tees (North East), while 68% did so in Reading (South East)</li>
<li>91% of White pupils met the expected standard in Kensington and Chelsea (London), while 66% did so in Leicester (East Midlands)</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 2 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 1 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage assessment data received from the Standard Testing Agency (STA) is combined with information on pupil's characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. Records are matched, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN (unique pupil number), gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 60% to 75% of pupils.</p>
<p>Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid result for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.</p>
<p>Valid results for the national test figures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>not achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>special consideration</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>working below the standard of the test</li>
<li>unable to access the test</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes to assessment:</p>
<p>Because of a change in the way pupils are assessed, data published before 2016 is not comparable to 2015/16 and 2016/17 data.</p>
<p>The system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.</p>
<p>This measure has been replaced by 'value added' progress measures in reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
<p>There is no 'target' for the amount of progress an individual pupil is expected to make, and any amount of progress a pupil makes contributes towards the school's progress scores.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages given in charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number.</p>
