<p>76% were White, 11% were Asian, 6% were Black, 5% were Mixed, 2% belonged to the Other ethnic group and 0.4% were Chinese</p>

<p>overall, 74% of pupils reached the expected standard for writing, and 15% met the higher standard </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the Chinese ethnic group had the highest percentage of children reaching both the expected and higher standard, at 84% and 29% respectively</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gypsy/Roma children did least well, with 29% reaching the expected standard and 1% reaching the higher standard </p>

<li>
<p>within every ethnic group, girls were more likely than boys to meet both the expected and the higher standard in writing</p>

<li>
<p>Bangladeshi children made the most progress in writing between key stage 1 and key stage 2, whereas pupils from a Traveller of Irish Heritage background made the least progress</p>

            <p>This data measures the writing attainment of children in key stage 2 (years 3 to 6, when pupils are aged between 7 and 11).</p>
<p>The data covers the academic year 2015/16 (September 2015 to July 2016).</p>
<p>Standards in writing are divided into 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>expected standard</li>
<li>higher standard</li>
</ul>
<p>To reach the expected standard, pupils must have been assessed as ‘working at the expected standard’ or ‘working at a greater depth within the expected standard’.</p>
<p>To reach the higher standard, pupils must have been assessed as ‘working at a greater depth within the expected standard’.</p>
<p>The progress score measures the progress that pupils make from the end of key stage 1 to the end of key stage 2, when they leave primary school. </p>
<p>A pupil’s results are compared to the actual achievements of other pupils nationally with similar key stage 1 attainment. This data compares the average progress score of all children in England with the score for particular ethnic groups.</p>
<p>A progress score of 0 (the national average) means pupils are making the expected amount of progress. A positive score (0.1 and above) means they are making more progress than expected, and a negative score (-0.1 and below) less progress than expected.</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The key stage 2 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 1 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage assessment data received from the Standard Testing Agency (STA) is combined with information on pupil's characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. 
Records are matched, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN (unique pupil number), gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 60% to 70% of pupils.</p>
<p>Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for progress results are calculated for a school based on a specific group of pupils. A school may have been just as effective, but have performed differently with a different set of pupils. Similarly, some pupils may be more likely to achieve high or low results, independently of which school they attend. </p>
<p>To account for this natural uncertainty, 95% confidence intervals around progress scores are provided in the data download. This means that if the progress scores of 100 random schools were taken, then 95 times out of 100 their progress score would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.</p>
<p>School scores should be interpreted alongside their associated confidence intervals. If the lower confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the school has achieved greater than average progress compared to pupils with similar starting points nationally.</p>
<p>Similarly, if the upper confidence interval is below zero, then the school has made less than average progress. Where the 95% confidence intervals overlap zero, this means that the school’s progress score is not significantly different from the national average.</p>
<p>The system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.</p>
<p>For this reason, the previous 'expected progress' measure, based on pupils making at least two levels of progress between key stage 1 and key stage 2, will not appear in the performance tables or Reporting and Analysis for Improvement through school Self-Evaluation (RAISEonline) in 2016.</p>
<p>This measure has been replaced by 'value added' progress measures in reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
<p>There is no 'target' for the amount of progress an individual pupil is expected to make, and any amount of progress a pupil makes contributes towards the school's progress scores.</p>
<p>Because of the changes to the curriculum, figures for 2016 are not comparable to those for earlier years.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid result for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.</p>
<p>Valid results for the national test figures are: </p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>not achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>special consideration</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>working below the standard of the test</li>
<li>unable to access the test</li>
</ul>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Figures for the Isles of Scilly and City of London are suppressed in DfE’s key stage 2 provisional Statistical First Release as these local authorities have a single school and DfE do not publish school level information in the performance tables at the time of the provisional release. These figures are unsuppressed in the revised release as school level figures are already published in the performance tables.</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>All charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number. Progress scores are given to 1 decimal place</p>
