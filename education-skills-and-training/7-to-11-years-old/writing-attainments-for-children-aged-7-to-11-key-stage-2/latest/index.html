<li>overall, in 2016/17, 76% of pupils met the expected standard in writing by the end of key stage 2 (when they are usually aged 10 or 11 years), and 18% met the higher standard</li>
<li>pupils from the Chinese ethnic group were most likely out of all ethnic groups to meet both the expected standard (jointly with pupils from the Indian ethnic group) and the higher standard</li>
<li>Gypsy/Roma pupils were least likely out of all ethnic groups to meet both the expected standard, and the higher standard (jointly with Irish Traveller pupils) </li>
<li>pupils from the Chinese ethnic group made the most progress in writing between key stage 1 and key stage 2, while Irish Traveller pupils made the least progress</li>
<li>within every ethnic group, girls were more likely than boys to meet both the expected and the higher standards in writing</li>
<li>the local authorities with the highest percentage of pupils meeting the expected standard were the City of London (where 92% did so) and Kensington and Chelsea (86%); the data for the City of London is based on small numbers of pupils and is therefore highly variable over time</li>

            <p>This data measures the writing attainment of children at the end of key stage 2 (year 6) when children are aged 10 to 11 years.</p>
<p>The data covers the academic year 2016/17 (September 2016 to July 2017).  Data for the academic year 2015/16 is available in the <a href="#download-the-data">download file</a>.</p>
<p>Standards in writing are divided into 2 categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>expected standard – to meet this, pupils must have been assessed as ‘working at the expected standard’ or ‘working at a greater depth within the expected standard’</li>
<li>higher standard – to meet this, pupils must have been assessed as ‘working at a greater depth within the expected standard’</li>
</ul>
<p>The progress score measures the progress that pupils make between the end of key stage 1 (primary school year 2) and the end of key stage 2 (year 6). A pupil’s results are compared with the actual achievements of other pupils nationally with similar key stage 1 attainment. </p>
<p>This data shows an average progress score for each ethnic group. A progress score of 0 (the national average) means pupils are making the expected amount of progress. A positive score (0.1 and above) means they are making more progress than expected, and a negative score (-0.1 and below) less progress than expected.</p>

                    <p>Except for the information for White pupils, the statistics quoted for attainment by ethnicity and local authority are often based on small numbers of pupils and are therefore highly variable over time. The number of pupils from different ethnic groups varies considerably between local authorities, and data isn't published for some local authorities where the number of pupils is 5 or fewer. For these reasons, you should avoid comparing differences in attainment between local authorities. </p>
<p>The Isle of Scilly had 17 pupils in year 6, and the City of London had 26 – results for these local authorities are particularly variable, and any comparisons with them are not recommended.</p>
<p>The data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>in 2016/17, 92% of pupils in the City of London local authority met the expected standard in writing by the end of key stage 2 – this was the highest percentage out of all local authorities, followed by Kensington and Chelsea (also in London), where 86% of pupils met the standard</li>
<li>100% of Asian pupils met the expected standard in County of Herefordshire (West Midlands), Plymouth (South West) and Rutland (East Midlands), while 65% did so in Calderdale (Yorkshire and the Humber) – these were the highest and lowest percentages of Asian pupils meeting the standard out of all local authorities</li>
<li>100% of Black pupils met the expected standard in Wirral in the North West, while 54% did so in North Lincolnshire (Yorkshire and The Humber) and Bath and North East Somerset (South West)</li>
<li>100% of Chinese pupils met the expected standard in 16 local authorities (out of the 63 local authorities for which data was available), while 33% did so in Portsmouth (South East)</li>
<li>92% of pupils with Mixed ethnicity met the expected standard in North East Lincolnshire (Yorkshire and The Humber), while 66% did so in Kirklees (also Yorkshire and The Humber)</li>
<li>86% of White pupils in Kensington and Chelsea (London) met the expected standard, while 41% did so in the Isles of Scilly (South West)</li>

              <p>The key stage 2 datasets are compiled using information matched together from 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>prior attainment records (key stage 1 results)</li>
<li>school census records</li>
<li>qualification entries and results collected from awarding bodies</li>
</ul>
<p>Key stage assessment data received from the Standard Testing Agency (STA) is combined with information on pupil's characteristics from the school census and prior attainment. Records are matched, using fields such as surname, forename, date of birth, UPN (unique pupil number), gender and postcode. This successfully matches around 60% to 75% of pupils.</p>
<p>Additional, more complex, routines are then applied to match as many of the remaining pupils as possible, up to around 98%. The coverage of the local authority and regional statistics is state-funded mainstream schools only in England. This includes schools and academies but excludes hospital schools, pupil referral units and alternative provision.</p>
<p>Any pupils who do not have a valid result for a subject are excluded from the calculations for that subject and do not appear in the number of eligible pupils or in the outcome percentages for that subject.</p>
<p>Valid results for the national test figures are:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>not achieved the expected standard</li>
<li>special consideration</li>
<li>absent</li>
<li>working below the standard of the test</li>
<li>unable to access the test</li>
</ul>
<p>Confidence intervals:</p>
<p>Confidence intervals are available for the ‘progress score’ if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a>. These confidence intervals are calculated for a school based on a specific group of pupils. A school may have been just as effective, but have performed differently with a different set of pupils. Similarly, some pupils may be more likely to achieve high or low results, independently of which school they attend. To account for this natural uncertainty, it is best to interpret these school scores alongside their associated confidence intervals. </p>
<p>A 95% confidence interval around progress scores means that if the progress scores of 100 random schools were taken, then 95 times out of 100 their progress score would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.</p>
<p>School scores are interpreted alongside their associated confidence intervals in the following manner: If the lower confidence interval is greater than zero, it can be interpreted as meaning that the school has achieved greater than average progress compared to pupils with similar starting points nationally. Similarly, if the upper confidence interval is below zero, then the school has made less than average progress. Where the 95% confidence intervals overlap zero, this means that the school’s progress score is not significantly different from the national average.</p>
<p>Changes to assessment:</p>
<p>Because of a change in the way pupils are assessed, data published before 2016 is not comparable to 2015/16 and 2016/17 data.</p>
<p>The system of national curriculum levels is no longer used by the government to report on end of key stage assessment.</p>
<p>This measure has been replaced by 'value added' progress measures in reading, writing and mathematics.</p>
<p>There is no 'target' for the amount of progress an individual pupil is expected to make, and any amount of progress a pupil makes contributes towards the school's progress scores.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 or a percentage based on 1 or 2 pupils who achieved, or did not achieve, a particular standard are suppressed. Some additional figures may be suppressed to prevent the possibility of a suppressed figure being revealed. This suppression is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Regional eligible pupil figures are rounded to the nearest 10 so that it is not possible to derive figures for these local authorities by summing the figures for the other local authorities in the region.</p>
<p>In the school level data, any figures relating to a cohort of 5 pupils or fewer are suppressed. This applies to sub-groups of pupils as well as the whole cohort, for example, if there were five boys and three girls in a school, DfE would not publish attainment for boys or girls separately but would publish attainment for all pupils as this is based on 8 pupils.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages given in charts, tables and downloads are rounded to the nearest whole number. Progress scores are given to 1 decimal place.</p>
