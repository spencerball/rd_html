            <p>This data measures the rate of temporary ('fixed period') and permanent exclusions in schools in England. The figures are broken down by ethnicity and type of school (primary, secondary and special).</p>
<p>Data is presented separately for fixed period (temporary) exclusions and permanent exclusions:</p>
<ul>
<li>a permanent exclusion refers to a pupil who is excluded and who will not return to the school they're excluded from (unless the exclusion is overturned)</li>
<li>a fixed period exclusion refers to a pupil who is excluded from a school for a set period of time (from part of the school day to 45 school days)</li>
</ul>
<p>Pupils can be excluded multiple times, as long as all fixed periods of exclusion for a pupil in an academic year don’t add up to more than 45 school days (including exclusions from previous schools).</p>
<p>As pupils can receive more than one fixed period exclusion, in some cases the exclusion rate may be above 100%.</p>
<p>This data records the number of occasions on which a pupil was excluded, not the number of pupils that were excluded, nor how often they were excluded. Individuals may therefore be included in the data more than once. This means that the exclusion rates should be considered with some caution.</p>
<p>Exclusions data relates to all exclusions reported across the full academic year. Exclusion rates are calculated as a percentage of the number of pupils registered as at the January school census.</p>

<p>the highest rates of permanent exclusion were for Traveller of Irish Heritage pupils, at 0.16% in primary schools and 1.49% in secondary schools – however, these figures are based on very small numbers of pupils so are less reliable than for ethnic groups with larger populations</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>Exclusions are reported by schools and collected through the school census every term. </p>
<p>Rates are calculated using the number of registered pupils as of the spring census (taken in January). </p>
<p>Schools use the agreed codes to record and monitor attendance and absence in a consistent way. You can see these codes in Annex C of the Department for Education’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/642577/Guide-to-exclusion-statistics-05092017.pdf">Guide to exclusion statistics</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>Both the number and rate of exclusions are included in published exclusions statistics. Rates of exclusion are a more appropriate measure for comparisons over time as they take into account changes in the total number of pupils across different academic years.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Enrolment numbers at national and regional levels are rounded to the nearest 5.</p>
<p>Local authority totals across school types are also rounded to the nearest 5 to prevent any suppressed values being disclosed.</p>
<p>Enrolment numbers of less than 3 and rates based on fewer than 3 pupil enrolments have been suppressed. This is because, where the size of the ethnic group population is small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed, information is suppressed to preserve confidentiality.  The Code of Practice for Official Statistics requires DfE to take reasonable steps to ensure that their published or disseminated statistics protect confidentiality.</p>
<p>For more information about DfE’s disclosure control procedures for its statistical releases please see <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190768/Confidentiality_Policy_v4.pdf">DfE’s statistical policy statement on confidentiality</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Enrolment numbers at national and regional levels are rounded to the nearest 5.</p>
<p>Local authority totals across school types are also rounded to the nearest 5 to prevent disclosure of any suppressed values.</p>
