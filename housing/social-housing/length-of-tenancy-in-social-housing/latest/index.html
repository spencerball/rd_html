            <p>This data measures the number and percentage of new lettings in social housing by length of fixed-term tenancy, for each ethnic group.</p>
<p>The data is for new lettings with fixed-term tenancies in 2016/17, which made up 18% of all social lettings made in that period (56,773 out of 318,150 lettings where ethnicity was known). Lifetime tenancies, which make up the remainder of new lettings, are not included in this data. </p>
<p>The data does not include lettings where a tenant starts a new tenancy agreement but stays in the same property (after their previous tenancy agreement ended).</p>
<p>The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.</p>
<p>The data uses the ethnicity of the main tenant. For a single tenancy, this is the named tenant.</p>
<p>For a joint tenancy, the main tenant is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the economically active or working person</li>
<li>the oldest person, if both tenants are working or both are not working</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are drawn from the Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing (CORE) system in 2016/17. CORE is a complete census of new social housing lettings, which records:</p>

<li>social housing lettings</li>

<ul>
<li>in 2016/17, there were 56,773 new social housing lettings with a fixed period tenancy length where the ethnicity of the household was known</li>
<li>overall, 23.4% of fixed-term tenancies were for 2 years or less, 63.3% of were for 3 to 5 years, 11.5% were for 6 to 9 years, and 1.8% were for 10 or more years</li>
<li>for all ethnic groups, the most likely length of a new fixed period tenancy for households renting social housing was 3 to 5 years</li>
<li>80.3% of Bangladeshi households had a tenancy length of 3 to 5 years, the highest percentage out of all ethnic groups – but only 8.2% of Bangladeshi households had a tenancy of longer than 5 years, the lowest of all ethnic groups</li>
<li>the second most common tenancy length was 2 years or less, accounting for 23.4% of all fixed-term lettings – 30.4% of Mixed White and Asian households had this length of tenancy, the highest percentage out of all ethnic groups</li>
<li>there were no large changes for ethnic groups between 2015/16 and 2016/17, although the overall percentage of fixed-term tenancies of 3 to 5 years increased from 54.9% to 63.3%</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The 3 main types of housing tenure in England are:</p>
<ul>
<li>owner occupiers</li>
<li>private renters</li>
<li>social renters</li>
</ul>
<p>This data refers to new lettings to social renters only. The data is based on the data collected from providers via the on-line Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing in England (CORE) system. CORE was first set up in 1989 and initially only required private registered providers (PRPs) to submit social housing lettings and sales information to support the government’s regulatory function. CORE’s remit expanded in 2004 to include local authority information.</p>
<p>Some questions on the CORE questionnaire are not compulsory. In particular, data on household characteristics (age, sex, economic status, ethnicity and nationality) may not be available to the housing officer or may be refused by the tenant.</p>
<p>The totals for new lettings used in this data differ from other published totals for new lettings, as they exclude lettings where ethnicity was refused.</p>
<p>Information on lettings of social housing in England is provided by local authorities and private registered providers (previously known as housing associations). Information about the tenancy, the tenants and the property is collected by data providers each time there is a new letting of a social housing property.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.</p>
<p>Data here has been weighted at the national level, but not at the regional or local authority area level. Weights are calculated for groups of similar local authorities, where these groups are defined by the Office of National Statistics UK area classifications, and they are based on the comparison with data from another Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government source on social housing data (Local Authority Housing Statistics).</p>
<p>For further information on weighting, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/677502/CORE_Quality_Report_2016-17.pdf">Quality Report</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Data has been suppressed if the number of new lettings in a category (for example ethnicity and income bracket) is either 1 or 2. This is mainly to avoid possible risk of disclosure and is consistent with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/rents-lettings-and-tenancies">confidentiality and disclosure practices</a> for the Continuous Recording (CORE) system.</p>
<p>The CORE system records information anonymously and maintains absolute confidentiality on tenants’ circumstances. Access to record-level information is only available through a licence agreement.</p>
<p>Further information on CORE disclosure practices can be found on the <a href="https://core.communities.gov.uk/public/download/guides-and-manuals/CORE%20dissemination%20&amp;amp;%20disclosure.pdf?download-format=pdf">CORE website</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages have been rounded to 1 decimal place. Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.</p>
