            <p>These figures are drawn from the Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing (CORE) system. CORE is a complete census of new social housing lettings.</p>
<p>Tenants can refuse to give information on their ethnicity. The data used here excludes any records where ethnicity was refused or where information was missing. This means that figures for new lettings may be different from other published figures on social housing. </p>
<p>Social housing is provided by local authorities and private registered providers (mainly housing associations), who are responsible for framing and operating their own policies for allocating social housing. </p>
<p>To access social housing through the local authority waiting list, a household has to be eligible under centrally set rules, qualify under rules determined locally, and have sufficient priority under the local authority’s allocation scheme</p>
<p>Some categories were combined with the category ‘Other’. This is because the figures for those categories were small enough that an individual’s identity could be revealed. These categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>relocated through recognised national, regional or sub-regional housing mobility scheme</li>
<li>youth offending team</li>
<li>community mental health team</li>
<li>health service</li>
</ul>
<p>A full list of the possible routes into social housing is on page 39 of the <a href="https://core.communities.gov.uk/public/download/guides-and-manuals/2015_16%20CORE%20Manual.pdf">CORE Manual 2015/16</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>The data uses the ethnicity of the main tenant. For a single tenancy, this is the named tenant.</p>
<p>For a joint tenancy, the main tenant is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the economically active or working person </li>
<li>the oldest person if both tenants are working or both are not working</li>
</ul>
<p>The figures come from the Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing in England (CORE) in 2015/16, which records:</p>
<ul>
<li>social housing lettings</li>
<li>affordable housing lettings</li>
<li>sales by private registered providers</li>
</ul>
<p>The CORE data used here relates to new, permanent general lettings of social housing. It doesn’t include other types of letting, except temporary lettings where a household moves into supported housing. Supported housing is housing that is either purpose designed or designated for a particular type of tenant.</p>
<p>It also does not include lettings where a tenant starts a new tenancy agreement but stays in the same property (after their previous tenancy agreement ended).</p>
<p>There may be some inaccuracy  in the administrative data used to compile these statistics due to missing responses or reporting errors when the data was entered.</p>

                    <p>This data shows that:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>in 2015/16 there were 355,898 new social housing lettings in England</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for almost all ethnic groups, the most likely route into social housing was  the tenant applying directly (accounting for 44% of new social housing lettings, or 155,639 lettings); the second most likely route was being nominated by a local housing authority (26% of new social housing lettings, or 91,594 lettings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>for Bangladeshi households, the most likely route into social housing was being nominated by a local housing authority – this accounted for 39% of new social lettings (1,285 lettings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in every ethnic group, these 2 routes into social housing accounted for more than half of all new social housing lettings; for households in the Other White ethnic group, these 2 routes accounted for 80% of lettings (11,926 lettings)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black Caribbean households were least likely to apply directly to get a new social housing letting, with 32% doing so (2,835 lettings)</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The three main types of housing tenure in England are:</p>
<ul>
<li>owner occupiers</li>
<li>private renters</li>
<li>social renters</li>
</ul>
<p>This data refers to new lettings to social renters only. The data is based on the data collected from providers via the on-line Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing in England (CORE) system. CORE was first set up in 1989 and initially only required private registered providers (PRPs) to submit social housing lettings and sales information to support the government’s regulatory function. CORE’s remit expanded in 2004 to include local authority information.</p>
<p>Some questions on the CORE questionnaire are not compulsory. In particular, data on household characteristics (age, sex, economic status, ethnicity and nationality) may not be available to the housing officer or may be refused by the tenant.</p>
<p>The totals for new lettings used in this data differs from other published totals for new lettings, as this data does not use estimated data for ethnicity and excludes those where ethnicity was refused. </p>
<p>Information on lettings of social housing in England is provided by local authorities and private registered providers (previously known as housing associations). Information about the tenancy, the tenants and the property is collected by data providers each time there is a new letting of a social housing property. </p>
<p>Weighting: </p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female. </p>
<p>Data here has been weighted at the national level, but not at the regional or local authority area level. Weights are calculated for groups of similar local authorities, where these groups are defined by the Office of National Statistics UK area classifications, and they are based on the comparison with data from another Department for Communities and Local Government source on social housing data (Local Authority Housing Statistics).</p>
<p>For further information on weighting, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/583478/CORE_Quality_Report_2015-16_revised_130117.pdf">Quality Report</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 have been suppressed, mainly to avoid possible risk of disclosure. This is consistent with the way the confidentiality of data within the Continuous Recording (CORE) system is maintained.  The Continuous Recording (CORE) system records information anonymously and maintains absolute confidentiality on tenants’ circumstances. Access to record-level information is only available through a licence agreement.</p>
<p>Further information on CORE disclosure practices can be found on the <a href="https://core.communities.gov.uk/public/download/guides-and-manuals/CORE%20dissemination%20&amp;%20disclosure.pdf?download-format=pdf">CORE website</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages have been rounded to 1 decimal place. Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.</p>
