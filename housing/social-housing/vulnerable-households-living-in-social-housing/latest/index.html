            <p>This data measures the number and percentage of new lettings in social housing given to vulnerable households. Local authorities must give ‘reasonable preference’ for social housing to certain households with a priority need for new accommodation.</p>
<p>The data is broken down by the ethnicity and priority need category of the household.</p>
<p>The priority need categories group vulnerable households according to whether:</p>
<ul>
<li>they need to move to a particular location in the district of the housing authority, where failure to meet that need would cause hardship</li>
<li>they are homeless</li>
<li>the local authority has a duty to house them in settled accommodation because they are unintentionally homeless and in a priority need category</li>
<li>they're accepted as unintentionally homeless, not in priority need and provided with accommodation at the council’s discretion</li>
<li>they are in unsanitary or overcrowded housing, or otherwise living in unsatisfactory housing conditions</li>
<li>they need to move for medical reasons or for their well-being, including reasons relating to a disability</li>
</ul>
<p>They have been grouped into 5 categories in the tables and charts:</p>
<ul>
<li>hardship</li>
<li>homelessness</li>
<li>insanitary/unsatisfactory housing</li>
<li>medical welfare</li>
<li>multiple (more than one need)</li>
</ul>
<p>The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.</p>
<p>The data uses the ethnicity of the main tenant. For a single tenancy, this is the named tenant.</p>
<p>For a joint tenancy, the main tenant is:</p>
<ul>
<li>the economically active or working person</li>
<li>the oldest person, if both tenants are working or both are not working</li>
</ul>
<p>These figures are drawn from the Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing (CORE) system in 2016/17. CORE is a complete census of new social housing lettings, which records:</p>
<ul>
<li>social housing lettings</li>
<li>affordable housing lettings</li>

<li>for all ethnic groups except the Bangladeshi group, the most likely reason for being given priority for social housing was homelessness</li>
<li>49.6% of Arab households were given priority because of homelessness, the highest percentage of any ethnic group</li>
<li>for Bangladeshi households, the most likely reason was the need to move out of unsanitary, unsatisfactory or overcrowded conditions, accounting for 46.5% of lettings to vulnerable households</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The three main types of housing tenure in England are:</p>
<p>owner occupiers
private renters
social renters</p>
<p>This data refers to new lettings to social renters only. The data is based on the data collected from providers via the on-line Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing in England (CORE) system. CORE was first set up in 1989 and initially only required private registered providers (PRPs) to submit social housing lettings and sales information to support the government’s regulatory function. CORE’s remit expanded in 2004 to include local authority information.</p>
<p>Some questions on the CORE questionnaire are not compulsory. In particular, data on household characteristics (age, sex, economic status, ethnicity and nationality) may not be available to the housing officer or may be refused by the tenant.</p>
<p>The totals for new lettings used in this data differs from other published totals for new lettings, as this data does not use estimated data for ethnicity and excludes those where ethnicity was refused.</p>
<p>Information on lettings of social housing in England is provided by local authorities and private registered providers (previously known as housing associations). Information about the tenancy, the tenants and the property is collected by data providers each time there is a new letting of a social housing property.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.</p>
<p>Data here has been weighted at the national level, but not at the regional or local authority area level. Weights are calculated for groups of similar local authorities, where these groups are defined by the Office of National Statistics UK area classifications, and they are based on the comparison with data from another Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government source on social housing data (Local Authority Housing Statistics).</p>
<p>Due to the weighting of the data, some counts may not have been made using whole numbers. There is therefore a small discrepancy between the total number of new social housing lettings awarded to vulnerable households where ethnicity was known (90,482) and the total you get when you add up the counts of lettings for all ‘type of priority need’ shown in our data (90,483).</p>
<p>For further information on weighting, see the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/677502/CORE_Quality_Report_2016-17.pdf">Quality Report</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Values of 1 or 2 have been suppressed, mainly to avoid possible risk of disclosure. This is consistent with the way the confidentiality of data within the Continuous Recording (CORE) system is maintained.</p>
<p>The CORE system records information anonymously and maintains absolute confidentiality on tenants’ circumstances. Access to record-level information is only available through a licence agreement.</p>
<p>Further information on CORE disclosure practices can be found on the <a href="https://core.communities.gov.uk/public/download/guides-and-manuals/CORE%20dissemination%20&amp;%20disclosure.pdf?download-format=pdf">CORE website</a> (PDF).</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages have been rounded to 1 decimal place. Due to rounding, some totals may not add up to 100%.</p>
