         Tenants can refuse to give information on their ethnicity. The data used here excludes any records where ethnicity was refused or where information on ethnicity is missing. This means that figures for new lettings may be different from other published figures on social housing.

         For example, 2 households may have the same number of people, but in one household there are several dependent children, while in the other, everyone is employed. In this data, the amount of rent as a percentage of household income has not been adjusted to reflect these differences.

         Social housing is let to tenants by local authorities or private registered providers (mainly housing associations).
        </p>
        <p>
         The figures come from the Continuous Recording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing (CORE) in 2015/16, which records:

         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         The CORE data used here relates to new, permanent general lettings of social housing. It doesn’t include other types of letting, except temporary lettings where a household moves into supported housing.

        <p>
         The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          CORE provides valuable information about new social housing lettings, sales, tenants and buyers across England.
This national information is used by government bodies and organisations to inform social housing funding, regulatory and housing policy decisions.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          The three main types of housing tenure in England are:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           owner occupiers
          </li>
          <li>
           private renters
          </li>
          <li>
           social renters
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          This data refers to new lettings to social renters only. The data is based on the data collected from providers via the on-line COntinuous REcording of Lettings and Sales in Social Housing in England (CORE) system. CORE was first set up in 1989 and initially only required private registered providers (PRPs) to submit social housing lettings and sales information to support the government’s regulatory function. CORE’s remit expanded in 2004 to include local authority information.
         </p>
         <p>
          Some questions on the CORE questionnaire are not compulsory. In particular, data on household characteristics (age, sex, economic status, ethnicity and nationality) may not be available to the housing officer or may be refused by the tenant.
         </p>
         <p>
          The totals for 'new lettings' used in this data differs from other published totals for new lettings, as this data does not use imputed data for ethnicity and excludes those where ethnicity was refused. Information on lettings of social housing in England is provided by local authorities and private registered providers (previously known as housing associations). Information about the tenancy, the tenants and the property is collected by data providers each time there is a new letting of a social housing property.
         </p>
         <p>
          Imputation:
         </p>
         <p>
          When data is missing it can be imputed, that is replaced with an estimated value based on other available information. For this measure all data at the regional and national level have not been imputed.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weighting:
         </p>
         <p>
          Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.
         </p>
         <p>
          For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.
         </p>
         <p>
          Data here has been weighted at the national level, but not at the regional area level. Weights are calculated for groups of similar local authorities, where these groups are defined by the Office of National Statistics UK area classifications, and they are based on the comparison with data from another Department for Communities and Local Government source on social housing data (Local Authority Housing Statistics).
         </p>
         <p>
          For further information on the weighting and imputation methodologies, please see the
