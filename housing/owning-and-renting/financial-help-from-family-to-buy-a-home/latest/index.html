         Compared with White British households, ethnic minority households tend to:
        </p>
        <ul>
         <li>
          be younger
         </li>
         <li>
          have lived in England for a shorter time
         </li>
         <li>
          be located in urban areas
         </li>
         <li>
          live in larger households
         </li>
         <li>
          live in rented accommodation
         </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
         To ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the data is drawn from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2014/15 and 2015/16.
        </p>
        <p>
         Information about households available from the EHS Headline and Annual Reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March) of the survey. Because of this some of the statistics cited here may not match those in the Headline and Annual Reports.
        </p>
        <p>
         The commentary only includes findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, information is not provided about households from Gypsy, Traveller or Irish Traveller, Mixed White and Black Caribbean, Mixed White and Black African, Other Mixed, Other Black or Arab ethnic backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not possible to look in detail into the financial help owner occupiers got from their family when they bought their home.  This is because the sample sizes of individual ethnic groups when further broken down by other characteristics, such as income, socio-economic group, region or age are not large enough to give reliable estimates.
        </p>
        <p>
         The EHS is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about the total population.
        </p>
        <p>
         For example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.
        </p>
        <p>
         The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.

         This data measures the differences by ethnicity in financial help given by family members to buy a home.
        </p>
        <p>
         ‘Financial help’ includes any gift or loan from family members which is used to pay all or part of the cost of buying a home.
        </p>
        <p>
         The figures are drawn from the 2014/15 and 2015/16 English Housing Survey (EHS). The survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year.
        </p>
        <p>
         These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England as a whole.
        </p>
        <p>
         The EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England.
        </p>
        <p>
         The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If they are a group they also must share cooking facilities and a living room, sitting room, or dining area.
        </p>
        <p>
         The EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The household reference person is the person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation.
        </p>
        <p>
         Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds; in these circumstances, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person to define the ethnic background of the household.
        </p>
        <p>
         Nearly all the household reference persons – more than 99.8% interviewed – provided information on their ethnicity.

          Purpose of data source
         </h3>
         <p>
          The English Housing Survey (EHS) is a continuous national survey commissioned by the Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG). It collects information about people’s housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of housing in England.
         </p>
         <h3 class="heading-small">
          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          The EHS consists of:
         </p>
         <ul>
          <li>
           face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year
          </li>
          <li>
           a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households – these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor
          </li>
         </ul>
         <p>
          The surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.
         </p>
         <p>
          Weighting:
         </p>
         <p>
          Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population.
         </p>
         <p>
          For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.
         </p>
         <p>
          Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable.
         </p>
         <p>
          Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.
         </p>
         <p>
          In the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22.6 million households in England.
         </p>
