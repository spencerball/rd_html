            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>
<p>around 8 million (37%) of the estimated 22.6 million households in England were under-occupying their home in the time period studied</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mixed White and Asian, White Irish and White British households were most likely to be under-occupying their home</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Black African, Mixed White and Black African, Arab, Bangladeshi, Mixed White &amp; Black Caribbean, Other Asian, Chinese,  Pakistani and Other White households were least likely to be under-occupying their home</p>

<li>
<p>across all socio-economic groups and regions in England, and regardless of whether they owned or rented their home, White British households were more likely than ethnic minority households to be under-occupying their home</p>

<li>live in larger households</li>
<li>live in rented accommodation</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure that there is a large enough number of ethnic minority households to produce reliable findings, the data is drawn from the English Housing Survey (EHS) 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16.</p>
<p>Information about households available from the EHS Headline and Annual Reports is normally based on a 12-month period (April to March) of the survey. Because of this some of the statistics cited here may not match those in the Headline and Annual Reports.</p>
<p>The commentary only includes findings based on subgroups of at least 30 households to ensure that we report reliable findings. For this reason, information is not provided about Gypsy or Irish Traveller households.</p>
<p>The EHS is a ‘sample survey’: it collects information from a random sample of the population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about the total population.</p>
<p>For example, EHS findings might include the percentage of households who get help from their family to buy their own home.</p>
<p>The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.</p>
<p>Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they are reflective of the total population rather than just the survey sample.</p>

        <div class="panel panel-border-narrow" itemprop="description">
            <p>This data measures households under-occupying their home and how different ethnic groups are affected.</p>
<p>Under-occupation is measured using the bedroom standard. This is the difference between the number of bedrooms needed to avoid undesirable sharing (based on the age, sex and relationship of household members) and the number of bedrooms actually available to the household.</p>
<p>For example, each married or cohabiting couple would be allowed a bedroom, as would an individual aged 21 or over and each pair of adolescents or children of the same sex. The bedroom standard is described in detail in the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/595785/2015-16_EHS_Headline_Report.pdf">English Housing Survey Headline Report 2015-16</a> (PDF).</p>
<p>A household is counted as under-occupied if it has at least 2 bedrooms more than it needs according to the bedroom standard. </p>
<p>The figures are drawn from the 2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16 English Housing Survey (EHS). The survey involves face-to-face interviews with about 13,300 randomly selected households every year.</p>
<p>These are used to make estimates for the 22.6 million households in England as a whole.</p>
<p>The EHS is a national survey of people's housing circumstances and the condition and energy efficiency of homes in England.</p>
<p>The information relates to households. A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If they are a group they also must share cooking facilities and a living room, sitting room, or dining area.</p>
<p>The EHS has ethnicity information on the household reference person as well as all other members of the household. The household reference person is the person in whose name the dwelling is owned or rented or who is otherwise responsible for the accommodation.</p>
<p>Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds; in these circumstances, we have used the ethnic background of the household reference person to define the ethnic background of the household.</p>
<p>Nearly all the household reference persons – more than 99.8% interviewed – provided information on their ethnicity.</p>
<p>The data is shown for the 9 regions of England: North East, North West, Yorkshire and the Humber, East Midlands, West Midlands, East, London, South East and the South West.</p>

<ul>
<li>White British</li>
<li>Other – all other ethnic groups (including White ethnic minorities and all other ethnic minorities)</li>
</ul>
<p>This is because the number of people surveyed to generate estimates for the population as a whole becomes too small to be reliable when also broken down by ethnicity and by another factor.</p>
<p>Data is therefore grouped to a size where estimates become reliable. In this case, information which is broken down by ethnicity and another factor compares White British with Other.</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The EHS consists of: </p>
<ul>
<li>face-to-face interviews with a random sample of about 13,300 households a year</li>
<li>a physical inspection of the homes of about 6,000 of the interviewed households – these are selected at random and carried out by a surveyor</li>
</ul>
<p>The surveyor also inspects a random sample of about 200 properties identified by the interviewer as vacant.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% females and 75% males will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know is around 50% male and 50% female.</p>
<p>Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. This helps to make them more reliable. </p>
<p>Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.</p>
<p>In the EHS, weighting makes the results more representative of the 22.6 million households in England.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Estimates based on less than 30 households have not been included in these statistics, because small numbers of households make it impossible to draw meaningful conclusions.  The analysis has been done by binary classification only where broken down by socio-economic group, income, region or age. This prevents small numbers appearing in the table and avoids the potential for identification of individuals.</p>
<p>More detailed data, including some potentially disclosive data, is protected by a range of disclosure controls. See the guidance on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/english-housing-survey-datasets-and-bespoke-analysis">English Housing Survey: datasets</a> for information accessing this data.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Estimates in the charts and tables are given to the nearest whole number. You can get more detailed estimates to 1 decimal place if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a>.</p>
