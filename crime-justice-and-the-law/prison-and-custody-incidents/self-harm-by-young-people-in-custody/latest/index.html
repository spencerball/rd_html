              <p>Self-harm is measured as the rate per 100 prisoners (taken from prison population monthly snapshots at the beginning of each month, including new admissions, averaged across a 12-month period).</p>
<p>The data is reviewed, but as with all large administrative surveys errors and omissions can occur.</p>
