          in 2015/16, police issued cautions to young people on 18,048 occasions, and the ethnicity of the young person who was cautioned was recorded for 16,613 of them (92%)

         Before 8 April 2013, police gave reprimands and final warnings to young people aged 10 to 17, but they were replaced on that date with youth cautions and youth conditional cautions. In this data, reprimands, final warnings  and youth conditional cautions are all treated as though they were youth cautions.
        </p>
        <p>
         If a young person is cautioned for 2 or more offences at the same time, the police officer will record all offences in the Police National Computer (PNC), with the most serious offence as the 'principal' offence. This is the offence presented here.
        </p>
        <p>
         The total figures for occasions include young people whose ethnicity is not recorded in the PNC. However, in every time period reported in this data, ethnicity has been recorded for at least 92% of cautions.
        </p>
        <p>
         Ethnicity is identified and recorded by the police officer giving the caution, based on appearance, and is not self-defined by the young person. Ethnicity has been consistently recorded in 4 broad categories: White, Black, Asian and Other (including Chinese).

         This data measures the number of occasions where a youth caution was given to young people aged 10 to 17.

         The figures are taken from the Police National Computer (PNC). The PNC holds details of all convictions and cautions given for ‘recordable offences’. A recordable offence is an offence that the law says must be recorded on the PNC. It includes some offences where it is not possible for offenders to be sentenced to prison or other custody, and it excludes motoring offences.

          Methodology
         </h3>
         <p>
          The figures are taken from the Police National Computer (PNC). The PNC holds details of all convictions and cautions given for ‘recordable offences’. A recordable offence is an offence that the law says must be recorded on the PNC. It includes some offences where it is not possible for offenders to be sentenced to prison or other custody, and it excludes motoring offences.
         </p>
         <p>
          The PNC may be subject to some error arising from data entry and processing. The data for January to March 2016 is provisional and may change.
         </p>
         <p>
          Admin data sources reported as recorded. As with all large administrative data sources, some inherent inaccuracy may exist.
