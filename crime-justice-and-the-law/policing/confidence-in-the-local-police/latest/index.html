            <p>These figures are based on the annual Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW).</p>
<p>The CSEW is a face-to-face survey in which people aged 16 or over living in England and Wales are asked about their experiences of a selected range of criminal offences in the previous 12 months.</p>
<p>The CSEW is able to capture a broad range of victim-based crimes experienced by those interviewed, not just those that have been reported to (and recorded by) the police. However, some offences such as homicide and sexual offences are not included in its main estimates.</p>
<p>Statistics on fraud and computer misuse have been included in CSEW data since 2015/16. However, as the data shown here dates back to 2013/14, the statistics and commentary exclude fraud and computer misuse offences.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that all survey estimates are based on a sample of the population, rather than the whole population. This means there’s a degree of uncertainty which is greater when the number of respondents is small. There are usually fewer respondents from ethnic minority groups due to the make-up of the general population – therefore, the level of uncertainty is higher for these groups.</p>
<p>Estimates based on fewer than 50 responses are excluded, as they are considered less reliable.</p>
<p>To increase the reliability of the data when broken down by gender, age group and socio-economic group, 3 years of data have been combined and the estimates presented are averages over this period. </p>
<p>This type of survey methodology means that some statistical tests for significant differences between ethnic groups have not been carried out. </p>
<p>The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings. Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings.</p>
<p>Differences are statistically significant if the results for the 2 groups or time periods being compared are within entirely different ranges.</p>
<p>The CSEW does not include:</p>
<ul>
<li>people living in communal establishments (such as care homes, student halls of residence and prisons)</li>
<li>crimes against commercial or public sector bodies</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>CSEW estimates are based on analysis of structured face-to-face interviews carried out using computer-assisted personal interviewing. In 2016/17, 74% of respondents completed the survey.</p>
<p>The CSEW is a household sample survey. Estimates are based on a representative sample of the population of England and Wales aged 16 and over. A sample, as used in the CSEW, is a small-scale representation of the population from which it is drawn.</p>
<p>Weighting:</p>
<p>Weighting is used to adjust the results of a survey to make them representative of the population and improve their accuracy.</p>
<p>For example, a survey which contains 25% women and 75% men will not accurately reflect the views of the general population, which we know has an even 50/50 split.
Statisticians rebalance or ‘weight’ the survey results to more accurately represent the general population. </p>
<p>Survey weights are usually applied to make sure the survey sample has broadly the same gender, age, ethnic and geographic make up as the general population.</p>
<p>The CSEW collects information from approximately 35,000 households each year. Since those responses reflect only a fraction of the total population of England and Wales, a process is used to give different weights to different households and individuals based on their sex, age and region, in such a way that the weighted distribution of responding household and individuals in these households matches the known distribution in the population as a whole.</p>
<p>First, weighting is applied to the raw data to compensate for:</p>
<ul>
<li>unequal address selection probabilities (given, some areas are more populated than others)</li>
<li>the observed variation in response rates between different types of neighbourhood</li>
<li>situations in which only one dwelling unit can be selected in multiple ‘dwelling unit' households</li>
<li>different probabilities of a respondent being selected based on different sized households</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, calibration weighting is used to make adjustments for known differences in response rates between different regions and between different age groups.</p>
<p>Socio-economic groups:</p>
<p>The National Statistics Socio-economic Classification (NS-SEC) categorises members of the adult public in the UK according to their occupational status.</p>
<p>The NS-SEC categories are:</p>
<ul>
<li>managerial and professional occupations</li>
<li>intermediate occupations (clerical, sales, service)</li>
<li>routine and manual occupations</li>
<li>never worked and long-term unemployed</li>
<li>full-time students</li>
<li>not classified</li>
</ul>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>Estimates based on fewer than 50 respondents have been suppressed as they are less reliable.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Estimates in the charts and tables are given to the nearest whole number. </p>
