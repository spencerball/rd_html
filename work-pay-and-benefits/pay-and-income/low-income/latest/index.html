            <p>This data shows the percentage of individuals living in households which have ‘persistent low income’.</p>
<p>Households are classed as being in low income if they live on less than 60% of the UK’s median income. Persistent low income means the household has had low income for at least 3 out of 4 years.</p>
<p>A household is one person or a group of people (not necessarily related) who have the accommodation as their only or main residence. If it is a group, they must share cooking facilities and also share a living room, sitting room or dining area.</p>
<p>Some households contain people from different ethnic backgrounds. In these cases, the ethnic background of the ‘household reference person’ is used  to define the ethnic background of everyone in the household. The household reference person is usually the member of the household with the highest income.</p>
<p>Two types of median income are used in this measure:</p>
<ul>
<li>median income before housing costs (BHC) are paid – this was £27,000 in 2015 to 2016</li>
<li>median income after housing costs (AHC) are paid – this was £23,000 in 2015 to 2016</li>
</ul>
<p>This data shows individuals living in households that are in persistent low income both before and after housing costs have been paid.</p>
<p>Presenting estimates before and after housing costs shows how the cost of housing has a greater or lesser impact on different groups. For example, pensioners, who may have paid off their mortgages, tend to spend a smaller proportion of their income on housing than people of working age, and they are therefore less likely to be in persistent low income after housing costs have been deducted. Over 70 per cent of pensioners in the Understanding Society survey in 2012 to 2016 had paid off their mortgages.</p>
<p>Income measured before housing costs includes any state benefits households receive to pay for housing.</p>
<p>Household incomes are adjusted (or ‘equivalised’) to take into account the number of adults and children who live there.</p>
<p>This data comes from the Department for Work and Pensions’ analysis of the Understanding Society survey run by the University of Essex.</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>These statistics are derived from the Understanding Society survey waves 2-7, 2010 to 2016.</p>
<p>Understanding Society is a UK household longitudinal study in which respondents in households are visited each year to collect information on changes to their household and individual circumstances. Interviews are typically carried out in respondents’ homes by trained interviewers. Household members aged 16 years or older are interviewed and the same individuals are re-interviewed in successive years to see how things have changed. Individuals become eligible for a full interview once they reach the age of 16 years.</p>
<p>Household incomes are adjusted (or ‘equivalised’) during the statistical calculation to take into account the number of adults and children who live there. Equivalisation adjusts incomes for household size and composition, taking an adult couple with no children as the reference point. After equivalisation has been applied, households with the same equivalised income can be said to have a comparable standard of living.</p>
<p>Weights have been applied which take the combined population subsamples, adjusting for unequal selection probabilities, differential non-response, and potential sampling error.</p>
<p>Estimates are subject to sampling error and remaining non-sampling bias.</p>
<p>Surveys gather information from a sample rather than from the whole population. The selection of the sample for the Understanding Society study is designed to be representative of the whole population, but there are limitations to this accuracy, due to, for example,  time and cost constraints. Thus, results from a sample survey are always estimates, not precise figures. This means that they are subject to a margin of error which can affect how changes in the numbers should be interpreted, especially in the short-term. Year-on-year movements should be treated with caution.</p>
<p>The data on income before housing costs is of better quality than that on income after housing costs, as fewer cases were available for analysis after housing costs. The University of Essex, which publishes the Understanding Society survey, plans to improve housing costs information for the next publication.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Purpose of data source</h3>
                <p>The Income Dynamics statistics are designed to report on income movements and the persistence of low income for various population groups. </p>
<p>Reporting on these issues is required under UK law and the Income Dynamics statistics are intended to supplement the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/households-below-average-income-hbai--2">Households Below Average Income (HBAI) statistics</a>. The analysis of the Income Dynamics data allows the tracking of changes in income over time for different population groups.</p>
