            <p>The data collected through the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) Claimant Service and Experience Survey is used to make generalisations about the total population. </p>
<p>Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty. This is because they are based on a sample of the population. The degree of uncertainty is greater when the number of respondents is small, so it will be highest for ethnic minority groups.</p>
<p>The commentary for this data only includes reliable, or ‘statistically significant’, findings.</p>
<p>Findings are statistically significant when we can be confident that they can be repeated, and reflect the total population rather than just the survey sample.</p>
<p>Specifically, the statistical tests used mean we can be confident that if we carried out the same survey on different random samples of the population, 19 times out of 20 we would get similar findings. </p>
<p>The commentary has focused on findings based on subgroups of at least 100 people to ensure that we report reliable findings.</p>
<p>All surveys carry the risk of biased results if some types of people were less likely to respond than others. To compensate for this, the responses to this survey have been weighted so they better reflect characteristics of the target population. For more about weighting, see <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology and type of data</a>.</p>
<p>Satisfaction figures are estimates based on respondents who have had recent contact with DWP. This means they may not reflect the whole claimant population. Bear in mind too that percentages may not add up to 100%, due to rounding and the way some participants answer the question. For example, some survey participants may have incorrectly given more than one answer or forgotten to answer the question, which means their responses were not included.</p>

            <p>This data measures the level of satisfaction of claimants who have had recent contact with the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP).</p>
<p>A ‘claimant’ is someone who gets disability benefits, out-of-work benefits or a State Pension.</p>
<p>The DWP Claimant Service and Experience Survey is held every 3 months, and around 16,000 claimants are interviewed each year. They are selected randomly from all claimants who, in the previous 3 months, have either made a new claim or have contacted DWP about a change of circumstances for an existing claim.</p>
<p>Claimants are asked how satisfied they were with the service they received, and offered a 4-point scale to reply, from ‘very satisfied’ to ‘very dissatisfied’. Their answers are grouped together to show the percentage of claimants who were satisfied ('fairly satisfied' or 'very satisfied') and the percentage who were dissatisfied ('very dissatisfied' or 'fairly dissatisfied').</p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The population sampled is not the claimant base but rather those claimants who have had recent contact with DWP. The survey is carried out quarterly across the financial year, and interviews about 16,000 claimants per year (about 4,000 every 3 months). The DWP Claimant Service and Experience Survey results are ‘weighted’ to compensate for different response rates between different groups of respondents, so that the findings fairly represent the range of disability and out-of-work benefit claimants, as well as pension claimants.    </p>
<p>The satisfaction measure is derived from survey responses to a single question in the survey, which is then aggregated to overall measures of satisfaction and dissatisfaction.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>For data quality reasons, it is Department for Work and Pensions policy to suppress any values based on fewer than 40 responses.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to 0 decimal places. However, gaps and differences between figures have been calculated on unrounded data. Percentages have been rounded up if greater than or equal to 0.5, and rounded down if less than 0.5 of a percentage point. </p>
<p>Estimates based on survey responses are subject to sampling error.</p>



            <h3 class="heading-small">
              Further technical information
            </h3>
              <p>Weighting was applied to the data to ensure the survey respondents were representative of the population for which estimates were being generated.</p>
