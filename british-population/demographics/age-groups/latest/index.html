<p>The Census is the only survey to give a detailed picture of the whole population of England and Wales. It makes it possible to compare different parts of the country as all households are asked the same questions within the same time period.</p>
<p>For the 2011 Census, around 25 million pre-addressed questionnaires were posted out to all households using a specially developed national address register. Households could return their questionnaire by post or complete it online. Census employees delivered questionnaires by hand to people living in residential care homes, hospitals, hostels, boarding schools, university halls of residence, mobile home parks, military bases and other communal establishments.</p>
<p>94% of households completed the 2011 Census. Of those, 97% answered the question about ethnicity.</p>
<p>Age can affect a number of outcomes. Younger people are more likely to be in rented accommodation, for example, whereas older people are more likely to be in poor health.</p>
<p>Age can also have an influence on, among other things, whether or not they are employed and which <a href="/british-population/demographics/socioeconomic-status/latest">socio-economic group</a> they are in.</p>

<li>the Black African group had a younger age profile than the Black Caribbean group, partly due to different immigration patterns – the first large wave of immigrants from the Caribbean was in the 1950s and 1960s, and most of their children were aged 40 to 55 years at the 2011 Census (accounting for nearly 30% of this ethnic group); the more recent immigration of Black Africans explains why 29% of people in this ethnic group were aged 25 to 39 years at the Census</li>
<li>out of all Black ethnic groups, the Other Black group had the highest percentage of people under 18 years (at 41.7%), and the Black Caribbean group had the lowest (at 20.1%)</li>
<li>the Black Caribbean ethnic group had the highest percentage of people aged 65 years and over (at 13.9%), and the Black African group had the lowest (at 2.4%)</li>

<li>52.6% of Mixed White and Black African people were aged under 18 years (the highest percentage out of all Mixed ethnicity groups), followed by 51.4% of Mixed White and Asian people</li>
<li>nearly 1 in 5 (18.0%) of people with Mixed ethnicity were under 5 years old, with the figure reaching 21.9% in the Mixed White and Black African group</li>

<ul>
<li>at the time of the 2011 Census, 19.7% of the population of England and Wales identifying as White were aged under 18 years, 27.8% were aged 18 to 39 years, 27.6% were aged 40 to 59 years, and 24.9% were aged 60 years and over</li>
<li>6.5% of the Irish population were aged under 18 years, the lowest percentage out of all White ethnic groups; the highest percentage was in the Gypsy and Irish Traveller group, where 35.8% of people were aged under 18 years</li>
<li>out of all White ethnic groups, the Irish group had the largest percentage of people aged 65 years and over (at 30.7%); the Gypsy and Irish Traveller had the lowest (at 6.0%)</li>
<li>42.4% of people from the Other White group were aged between 18 and 34 years, over twice the percentage of White British people in the same age group (20.3%) – this is likely to reflect recent patterns of migration from Europe</li>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>All households in England and Wales received a census questionnaire through the post. The questionnaire was accompanied by an information leaflet and a pre-paid envelope for return by post.</p>
<p>Households in Wales received both English language and Welsh language questionnaires, and information leaflets.</p>
<p>Householders could complete their questionnaire and return it by post or they could complete the census questionnaire online. Each paper questionnaire had an internet access code which was unique to that household which enabled the householder to complete their questionnaire online.</p>
<p>Questionnaires returned via the post, or through the internet, were receipted daily and this information uploaded onto the questionnaire tracking (QT) system. This enabled the identification of households for follow-up where a questionnaire had not been returned or completed online.</p>
<p>Communal establishments, for example, managed accommodation (such as care homes) and special groups (such as travellers) had their census questionnaires hand delivered.</p>
<p>In communal establishments, questionnaires were collected by the special enumerators and transferred to the census processing site via the census coordinators. Individuals within communal establishments also had the option of completing their questionnaire online following the same process as that used by households.</p>
<p>2011 Census questions
There were 56 questions on the 2011 Census questionnaire: 14 about the household and its accommodation and 42 for each member of the household. For those living in Wales, there was a Welsh and English version of the questionnaire, and an extra question about the Welsh language.</p>
<p>Questions included those about work, health, national identity, passports held, ethnic background, education, second homes, language, religion and marital status.</p>
<p>Previous Census questionnaires can be seen in the 200 years of the Census section.</p>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Suppression rules and disclosure control</h3>
              <p>The ONS uses a number of ways to protect the confidentiality of individuals and households, including: </p>
<ul>
<li>record swapping, where small numbers of records are swapped between geographical areas</li>
<li>restricting the amount of detail shown in published data, particularly at low level geographies like local authorities</li>
</ul>

                <h3 class="heading-small">Rounding</h3>
                <p>Percentages are rounded to 1 decimal place.</p>
