            <div class="bullets spaced-out">
                <ul>
<li>
<p>overall, in the period from 2014 to 2016, 40.1% of people aged 15 years and older who were newly diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed at a late stage of infection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the same period, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection was significantly higher than the national average among the Black African and Asian ethnic groups, and significantly lower than the national average among the White group </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between 2009/11 and 2014/16, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection significantly declined for the White, Black African and Mixed/Other ethnic groups; although the figures show a large drop for the Other Black group, there were too few people in this group to draw firm conclusions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>throughout the period from 2009/11 to 2014/16, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection was significantly higher in the Black African ethnic group compared with all other ethnic groups (except for the Other Black ethnic group in the period 2009/11 to 2011/13)</p>

            <p>This data measures the percentage of HIV diagnoses among residents of England aged 15 years or older that are made at a late stage of infection. </p>
<p>Late stage infection is identified by laboratory tests on the patient’s blood, which analyse the count of CD4 cells (a type of white blood cell) at the time of diagnosis. The diagnosis is classed as ‘late stage’ if the patient has a CD4 count of fewer than 350 cells per cubic millimetre (mm3) of blood.</p>
<p>The data only includes patients with CD4 cell counts that are available within 91 days of diagnosis. Counts available after this period are not counted as having been taken at the time of diagnosis, and may be affected if the patient has started treatment.</p>
<p>CD4 is a type of white blood cell that’s necessary for a healthy immune system.  If untreated, an HIV infection will diminish the number of CD4 cells over time. Clinical guidelines recommend that patients should begin anti-retroviral therapy when CD4 cells counts drop to fewer than 350 cells per mm3.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>overall, in the period from 2014 to 2016, 40.1% of people aged 15 years and older who were newly diagnosed with HIV were diagnosed at late stage of infection (5,136 out of 12,807 people)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in the same period, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection was significantly higher than the national average among the Black African and Asian ethnic groups (at 55.3% and 46.7% respectively), and significantly lower than the national average among the White group (at 35.1%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>between 2009/11 and 2014/16, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection fell significantly for White people (from 42.0% to 35.1%), Black African people (from 63.9% to 55.3%), and people from the Mixed/Other ethnic group (from 45.3% to 36.0%); although there appears to be a large drop for the Other Black group, there were too few people in this group to draw firm conclusions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>throughout the period from 2009/11 to 2014/16, the percentage of people whose HIV diagnosis was made at a late stage of infection was significantly higher in the Black African ethnic group compared with all other ethnic groups (except for the Other Black ethnic group in the period 2009/11 to 2011/13) </p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>Data on patients newly diagnosed with HIV and those accessing HIV care is collected and processed using the HIV and AIDS Reporting System (HARS) dataset. The dataset includes laboratory reports of patients’ CD4 blood counts. </p>
<p>HARS data is submitted every 3 months by all outpatient HIV service providers. </p>
<p>The data on diagnoses of HIV at a late stage is collected, validated, de-duplicated and matched using HARS by the HIV &amp; STI department of PHE’s National Infections Service. </p>
<p>Data is as reported by service providers but relies on ‘record linkage’ to integrate data and ‘de-duplication’ to prevent double counting of the same individual. Every effort is made to ensure accuracy and completeness of the data, including web-based reporting with integrated checks on data quality. However, responsibility for the accuracy and completeness of data lies with the service providers that submit the data. Service providers have to follow a <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hiv-and-sti-data-sharing-policy">data sharing policy</a> to ensure data is consistent and patient confidentiality is protected.</p>
<p>Data supplied for previous years is updated every year to account for clinic/laboratory resubmissions and improvements to data cleaning.</p>
<p>Confidence intervals:</p>
<p>The confidence intervals for the estimate of the percentage of all newly diagnosed adults with late HIV diagnosis are available if you <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a>.</p>
<p>In the period from 2014 to 2016, the percentage of late HIV diagnoses for people  of White ethnicity aged 15 years and over was 35.1%. This is a reliable estimate based on the number of people diagnosed with late stage HIV infection as a proportion of those who were newly diagnosed, but it is not possible to be 100% certain of the true rate of late diagnosis for this population due to the effect of natural variation. </p>
<p>It’s 95% certain, however, that the rate of diagnosis of HIV at a late stage of infection lies somewhere between 33.7% and 36.4% of White people who were newly diagnosed with HIV. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall in this range (ie between the upper and lower confidence interval). But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range. </p>
<p>The smaller the number of new diagnoses, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. To illustrate this, in the period from 2014 to 2016 there were fewer diagnoses of HIV infection among people from the Any other Black ethnic group than for White people, so we can be less certain about the estimate of 43.2% diagnosed with HIV infection at a late stage for the Any other Black group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by the wider confidence interval of between 35.3% to 52.3% of people from the Any other Black ethnic group who were newly diagnosed at a late stage of HIV infection.</p>
<p>Statistically significant differences are where the 95% confidence interval around the estimate for an ethnic group does not overlap with the confidence interval around the estimate for the group it’s being compared with.</p>

              Further technical information
            </h3>
              <p>To reflect the 2008 British HIV Association (BHIVA) treatment guidelines, the definition of a late HIV diagnosis was updated from a CD4 count of less than 200 cells/mm3 within 91 days of diagnosis to less than 350 cells/mm3 within 91 days of diagnosis. </p>
<p>The data for all of the years presented here reflects the updated definition of a late-stage infection (of fewer than 350 cells/mm3).</p>
<p>The  method for calculating confidence intervals at 95% significance was based on the exact binomial (Clopper–Pearson) interval. This method produces a slightly wider confidence interval, and is thus slightly more conservative in determining significant difference, compared to the Wilson score interval.</p>

                <p>The HIV and AIDS Reporting System (HARS) dataset is designed to increase the efficiency of HIV surveillance, enhance standard outputs on HIV surveillance, produce quality of care indicators, and directly support commissioning services. </p>
<p>People who have a late-stage HIV infection have usually had HIV for at least 3 years, and are therefore at a higher risk of premature death and of transmitting the virus to their sexual partners. For this reason, reducing late HIV diagnosis is a clinical and public health priority. </p>
<p>The HARS dataset was developed by Public Health England (PHE) in conjunction with Department of Health and the Clinical Reference Group for HIV.</p>
