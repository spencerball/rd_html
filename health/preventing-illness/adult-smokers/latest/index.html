            <p>It is unlikely that everyone who currently smoked when they were surveyed responded accurately. This may be because of social stigma that some people attach to smoking or other concerns they may have had when giving an answer. As a result, the findings probably underestimate the true percentage of people who were current smokers.</p>
<p>Within each ethnic group the smoking rate can vary considerably between men and women. Data on gender variation in rates within ethnic groups is not reflected here but will be added to this measure at a later date.</p>
<p>Keep in mind when making comparisons between ethnic groups that all survey estimates are subject to a degree of uncertainty, as they are based on a sample of the population.

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>The Annual Population Survey has a sample size of approximately 290,000 respondents. Interviews are carried out either on a face-to-face basis or on the telephone.</p>
<p>Weighting</p>
<p>Surveys collect information from a random sample of the target population to make generalisations (reach 'findings’) about everyone within that population.</p>
<p>For those findings to be reliable, the sample of people should ideally contain the same mix of age, gender and regional location as the target population.</p>
<p>Where this isn’t the case (because some people haven’t responded, for example) analysts use statistical tools to ‘weight’ the data. Weighting rebalances the survey responses so they represent the target population more accurately. They can then be used to reach meaningful conclusions. </p>
<p>The APS datasets are weighted to reflect the size and composition of the general population, by using the most up-to-date official population data. Weighting factors take account of the design of the survey (which does not include communal establishments) and the composition of the local population by age and gender. The weights for other sample members are then adjusted to compensate for this. </p>
<p>Confidence intervals</p>
<p>Confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in the <a href="#download-the-data">download the data</a> section. </p>
<p>Based on APS data, it’s estimated that 16.9% of adults were current smokers in England in 2015.</p>
<p>The APS data is based on the responses of a sample of adults in England rather than all adults in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of adults in England who were current smokers at the time of the survey, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage. </p>
<p>It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 16.7% and 17.1% of all adults in England were current smokers in 2015. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.</p>
<p>The smaller the survey sample, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer adults from the Chinese ethnic group responded to the survey than White adults, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 10% and 14.5% for Chinese adults in 2015.</p>
<p>All the differences noted in the text are statistically significant. The statistical significance of differences are approximate because they are determined where the 95% confidence intervals for 2 groups or time periods don't overlap.</p>
<p>An example of non-overlapping confidence intervals would be the 2015 results for the Chinese ethnic group, which had a confidence interval of between 10.0% and 14.5%, and the White ethnic group, which had a confidence interval of between 17.4% and 17.8%.</p>
<p>The Normal Approximation method for calculating confidence intervals has been used. </p>
