<p>in 2015/16, an estimated 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 in England were overweight   </p>

</li>
<li>
<p>in both the 4 to 5 and the 10 to 11 age groups, Black African children were the most likely to be overweight in 2015/16, with almost a third (31.2%) of the younger group and nearly half (45.9%) of the older group overweight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in 2015/16, Black African children aged 4 to 5 were more than twice as likely to be overweight compared with Indian children, of whom 14.5% were overweight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>among children aged 10 to 11, children from the Mixed White and Asian group were least likely to be overweight (30.1%) in 2015/16, followed by Chinese children (30.2%)</p>

            <p>This data measures the percentage of children who are overweight in 2 age groups – reception year (4 to 5 years old) and year 6 (10 to 11 years old). The data covers children in state-funded mainstream schools but not those in independent or special schools.</p>
<p>Estimates are based on measurements of children in the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) in participating state-funded mainstream schools schools in England in academic years 2014/15 to 2015/16. The data is collected to help support local health initiatives and services for children.</p>
<p>Defining a child as overweight is a complex process because a child’s weight and height change at the same time as they grow. For information on that process see <a href="#methodology-and-type-of-data">Methodology and type of data</a>.</p>

<p>the percentage of children aged 4 to 5 who were overweight was significantly lower than the 22.1% national average in the following ethnic groups: Indian, Mixed White and Asian, Chinese, Pakistani, Other Asian, Bangladeshi, and Other White </p>

<li>
<p>in both age groups, Black African children were the most likely to be overweight in 2015/16, with almost a third (31.2%) of the younger group and nearly half the older group (45.9%) overweight </p>

              Methodology
            </h3>
              <p>Launched in 2005/06, the National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures over one million children each year and is a valuable source of data on childhood obesity. </p>
<p>Measurements of height and weight are collected from children in reception (ages 4 to 5) and year 6 (ages 10 to 11), primarily in state-funded mainstream schools in England. This analysis is based only on children in state-funded mainstream schools that participated in the programme. </p>
<p>The NCMP uses a child’s body mass index reference to determine if a child is overweight or obese. For more information on the NCMP and how the programme determines if a child is overweight or obese, see the <a href="http://content.digital.nhs.uk/ncmp">NCMP website</a>.</p>
<p>Children aren’t required to participate in the programme, but if they don’t want to they need to opt out. In 2015/16 there were 1,170,000 participants, with only 5% of pupils opting out. </p>
<p>Confidence intervals</p>
<p>The confidence intervals for each ethnic group are available in <a href="#download-the-data">Download the data</a>. </p>
<p>Based on the NCMP measurements, it’s estimated that 22.1% of children aged 4 to 5 and 34.2% of children aged 10 to 11 were overweight in England in 2015/16.</p>
<p>The NCMP is calculated from the number of schoolchildren aged 4 to 5 and aged 10 to 11 in state-maintained schools, rather than all schoolchildren of those ages in England. This measure makes a reliable estimate of the percentage of children of these ages in England who are overweight, but it’s impossible to be 100% certain of the true percentage. </p>
<p>It’s 95% certain, however, that somewhere between 22.0% and 22.2% of all 4 to 5 year olds were overweight in 2015/16. In statistical terms, this is a 95% confidence interval. This means that if 100 random samples were taken from the total population of school age children in England, then 95 times out of 100 the estimate would fall between the upper and lower confidence interval. But 5 times out of 100 it would fall outside this range.</p>
<p>The smaller the size of the population, the more uncertain the estimate and the wider the confidence interval. For example, fewer children from the Chinese ethnic group are enrolled in state-maintained schools in England than White children, so we can be less certain about the estimate for the smaller group. This greater uncertainty is expressed by a wider confidence interval, for example of between 15.6% and 18.6% for Chinese children aged 4 to 5 in 2015/16.</p>
<p>Statistically significant findings have been determined where the 95% confidence intervals of an ethnic group do not overlap with the England value.</p>

                <p>The National Child Measurement Programme (NCMP) measures the height and weight of children in reception class (aged 4 to 5 years) and year 6 (aged 10 to 11 years) to assess overweight and obesity levels in children within primary schools. This data can be used at a national level to support local public health initiatives and inform the local planning and delivery of services for children.</p>
<p>The programme is recognised internationally as a world-class source of public health intelligence and holds UK National Statistics status.</p>
